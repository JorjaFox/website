If ever a TV couple shared some great chemistry it's Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom.

But after years of successfully concealing their relationship from their colleagues - and from us - no sooner is the cat out of the bag, than Sara's off.

So now I'm wondering if maybe it was just the secrecy that was the real attraction for Sara, and the thought of being able to hold hands with Gil in the CSI canteen and drive in to work together each day is just too mundane for words.

Romance apart, though, ever since being abducted by the miniature killer and left for dead in the desert, Sara's heart's not really been in the job.

But she gets momentarily fired up tonight when two murder suspects from a couple of series ago seem to be involved in the death of a teenage girl who's fallen out of a window, or, in CSI speak, "the defenestrated college kid".

Still, even settling some old scores isn't enough to stop Sara from kissing her finance Gil goodbye (yes, really) as Jorja Fox bows out of the series. Will she ever return? Watch this space.
