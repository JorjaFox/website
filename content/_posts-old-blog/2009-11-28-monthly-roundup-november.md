<h2>Charity and Fundraisers</h2>
November was the month JAA and JFO joined forces yet again for charity.  This time it's to raise money for <a href="http://ahopeforchildren.com">AHOPE</a>, to help children in Africa with AIDS.  This fundraiser runs through the end of the year, so please <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/607633.html">check out the details</a>

In addition, Jo (aka Hodiestoe) is raising money to go teach in Rwanda for a year!  Check out how YOU can help her humanitarian work via her <a href="http://joisaway09.livejournal.com/">fundraiser</a> so she can <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/11/06/send-jo-to-rwanda/"> raise $6000 to go teach in Rwanda for a year</a>.

Finally in local news, a Greyhound Racetrack in Wisconsin is closing at the end of the year, and 900 dogs need a home or they'll be put down. Yes, they're going to euthanize the dogs if they don't get adopted.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/forums/topic/help-save-the-greyhounds">Help save the greyhounds!</a>

<h2>CSI</h2>
So since "Death and the Maiden" was supposed to be Jorja's last episode, it's not too much of a weirdness that her scenes were cut.  What was weird was CBS dropped the ball and was still advertising that she <em>WAS</em> in the episode.  This meant I sent out bad information to CSI Watch email list. Please accept my humble apologies.  You can see how hard this is, even for an 'uber fan' (thank you, Chris, who called me that) to find accurate information right now!  CBS is having problems in the PR department.

That said, I can cheer you up with the news that Jorja is now listed as a series <em>regular</em> starting with episode 10, "Better off Dead", which airs December 17th. So tune in to see if/where she is in the credits.

<h3>CSI Episode</h3>

<h3>Upcoming Spoilers</h3>
We also have some cool spoilers from Allen MacDonald about the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/11/17/allen-macdonald-hints-about-saras-future/">return of a certain young genius</a> and some <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/11/16/csi-filming-sighting-nov-4th/">filming for the Christmas episode</a>.

<h2>General Site News</h2>
<h3>JFO TV on Twitter</h3>
<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/jfo_tv_128x128-100x100.png" alt="jfo_tv_128x128" title="jfo_tv_128x128" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2107" /> I cranked out a bot on Twitter called @JFO_TV, whose sole purpose is to tweet with Jorja's upcoming TV appearances.  More than CSI Watch, this Twitter account should pick up everything from <em>ER</em> to <em>Dead Drunk</em>.  As long as the episode listing mentions Jorja, it should get caught.  I call this experimental, but if you're inclined, follow along! It may be a little spammy when we have a CSI marathon, so personally I'd be cautious if you're sensitive to Twitter Spam.  If you have any problems, drop me a note and I'll look into it ASAP for you!

<h3>Advertising</h3>
I've started experimenting with <a href="http://www.projectwonderful.com">Project Wonderful</a>, which lets me be more granular about what ads are posted here.  Less weight loss, more indy. If you're interested in putting an ad up on JFO, check out <a href="http://www.projectwonderful.com/viewprofile.php?id=40958">my profile on Project Wonderful</a>. And as always, if you see an ad that's downright offensive or you feel should be yanked, please grab the URL the ad points to (yes, I know that may mean clicking on it, sorry) and email it to webmaster(AT)jorjafox.net and I will have it removed ASAP.

<h3>Hate Mail and My Apology</h3>
I'm going to close this out with an apology to anyone I insulted, directly or by implication, on November 17th.

This month, George Eads had a <a href="http://www.tv.com/story/18820.html?tag=hotspot;gumball;1">live online chat</a> where he came off sounding a bit disparaging in regards to his fellow cast members.  A couple people, who happened to be Jorja fans, called George names. My personal feelings aside, since the name calling wasn't on JFO, it's not my business to police those sites, so my responses were just my personal views, which were nothing radical.  I figured that it wasn't a big deal at all and merrily went on my day.

What I got was a slew of hate mail, accusatory PMs, and veiled threats.   As far as I can reason out, George Eads fans were blaming me for the action of Jorja Fox fans, and Jorja Fox fans were claiming I wasn't a 'real' fan because I wasn't defending them against the upset George fans.  The only actual 'argument' I got in about it was with someone who didn't like the name calling, and we ended up agreeing about the whole matter and I now follow her on Twitter.

<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/NotInternetPolice.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/NotInternetPolice-100x100.jpg" alt="NotInternetPolice" title="NotInternetPolice" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2125" /></a>  The confusion came, in part, because I show up (in my guise as <strong>Ipstenu</strong>) as an admin on <a href="http://www.yourtaxdollarsatwork.org">YTDaW</a>, and I was posting there as a fan.  To clarify that matter, I'm not an admin on YTDaW. I host them, I run the server, and I assist with technical matters, but I'm not a part of the user/moderator staff, and I have no input in that aspect of the site. That confusion I understand, and I don't fault people for it at all. What I do fault people for is the strange idea that it's my job to police Jorja fans around the net.

I am, in no way, responsible in any way shape or form for people acting like prats on any website, other than jorjafox.net.  So whatever punishment you get on those sites has jack to do with me.  I <em>only</em> admin/staff/mod here.  And if I ban you here, I will email you privately to explain why.  Just like you, I'm allowed to have my own personal views on matters related to CSI and Jorja Fox.  When I post here, I try to make it very clear when I'm being 'site admin' and reporting news, and when I'm being Ipstenu-the-Fan and speculating.

This is why I don't advocate sending those angry emails.  My feelings were hurt, and I can imagine how some of you felt who were getting personal attacks.  There's no call for hate mail or a flame war, and we should all be mature enough to agree to disagree.  There is no one right, perfect way to handle a situation, but in my opinion, spreading hate can't be right.

Those of you who apologized personally, or sent emails for other people, or who generally were supportive when I was being hurt and bitchy, thank you again. I'm sorry if I was mean to you that day, I had no business spreading my bad mood onto you and there's no excuse for my poor behavior. I know better, and I'll try to act that way in the future.
