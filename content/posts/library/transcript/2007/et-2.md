**Jorja Fox:** How fun is this, right? And what a tease for me!

**Jann Carl:** I know!

**Fox:** Such a tease! They tell -- I'm under the understanding that when I'm done today, they're gonna let me take a little spin around the track.

**Carl:** You're back?

**Fox:** I made it! I made it. I survived. I know.

**Carl:** And you don't look any worse off for it.

**Fox:** Well thank you. No worse for wear.

**Carl:** You fooled everybody all summer. 

**Fox:** Yeah.

**Carl:** So When you would see people this summer, what were- What happened?

**Fox:** My family has asked me questions, and I have to say to them 'Come on. You know!' You know? And really, I lied to my own family. 'I don't know anything.'

**Carl:** What's going to happen with you - with Sara and Grissom. That, okay, it's out, now it's out. They didn't want it to be out.

**Fox:** I know! You know what? I'm under a car, and he goes and tells everybody that we're having an affair! I couldn't believe it! You know, I don't know. I wish I could tell you.
