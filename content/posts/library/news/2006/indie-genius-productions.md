**- Feature film will cover animal rights activists' trial and conviction -**

An animal rights group known as the SHAC7 (Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty) will be sentenced today September 12th on domestic terrorism charges in Trenton, New Jersey. This was a landmark test case for the U.S. government and the first of its kind using the Animal Enterprise Protection Act. The defendants said it was a 'freedom of speech' issue, and the U.S. government disagrees and call them "thugs".

Producer/director Curt Johnson follows this historic case in his latest film "Your Mommy Kills Animals"; an indepth look at the animal rights movement and the FBI's recent declaration calling them the 'number one domestic terrorist threat to the United States'. Johnson's recent films include the 2002 Academy Award winning documentary "Thoth". The film looks at both sides of the animal rights movement.

The film is slated for a spring 2007 national theatrical release and includes child star Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy from "Peanuts", "Lassie", "Odd Couple"), Willie Nelson, Moby, Joe Mantegna, Jorja Fox, Drew Carey, Ben Stein among others voicing their opinions on this controversial movement and trial.
