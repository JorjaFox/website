On the heels of news that Rory Cochrane is returning to one of the other CSI shows, CSI: Miami, comes this news: Jorja Fox is probably on her way out.

CSI Producer Carol Mendolsohn tells TV Guide's Michael Ausiello that they have just cast a new female lab technician that will be introduced in the third episode, and there are hints that she's not just a new cast member but a new cast member that will take over for Jorja Fox, whose Sara character might die in that car crash. Executive Producer Jonathan Littman says that the Grissom/Sara storyline will definitely be resolved, and didn't say if Fox would be in the show this season beyond the season opener.

So I guess now we can try to figure out how a dead Sara will come back to the show a year from now.
