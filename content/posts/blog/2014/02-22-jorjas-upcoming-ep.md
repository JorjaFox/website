Louis Milito (whom I had the pleasure of meeting very quickly) is working on episode 19, which seems to involve blowing the heck up out of the PD:

I should note when Jorja showed us that part of the set, we both remarked it was heavily underused. She hadn't seen this script yet, so I hope she finds this as funny as I do!

Oh, and her being it in? Here's Frank Waldeck's photo:

Wonder what the little kid has to do with this. Do you want some spoilers? Okay, episode 19 is called "The Fallen" and DB will be held hostage (I'm guessing at the PD). It's possible this is episode 20, since Jorja mentioned that:

So really it's hard to tell some times! If this is 20, then I believe that one is about cannibals. Tasty. But the hostage situation makes me think this is 19.

Speaking of spoilers, by now you've all heard about the CSI spinoff, to do with the Internet. That's pretty much all I know too, and I haven't announced anything because this is a Jorja Fox site, not a CSI site, and thus far there's no word about Sara being over there. If that changes, we'll talk about it. For now, treat it like CSI Miami and CSI NY. Dem other shows.
