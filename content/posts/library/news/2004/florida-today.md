Two stars of the CBS hit television series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" - one who grew up in Brevard County - were fired for breach of contract, KCBS-TV and Variety reported.

Jorja Fox attended Melbourne High School.

Actors Jorja Fox, who attended elementary and high school in Melbourne, Fla., and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes, were fired after asking for more money to stay on the show, according to the reports.

Danica Smith, publicist for both Fox and Eads, told The Associated Press that Fox was fired Wednesday but did not have details. Smith could not confirm whether Eads was fired.

A CBS spokesman said the network had no comment.

Eads didn't show up for work Thursday, the first day of production for the next season, according to the news station and Variety, which posted a story on its Web site Thursday.

The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts.

Though a search was under way for their replacements, it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones, the reports said.

The show picked up four Emmy nominations Thursday, including one for best drama series.

Fox grew up in Melbourne Beach attending Gemini Elementary and Melbourne High among other schools.

In addition to CSI, Jorja had stints on the short-lived "Missing Persons" television series as well as "The West Wing" in 1999 and "ER" in 1994.

In 2000, she hit the big screen appearing in the film "Memento."

Fox, who was a candy-striper at Holmes Regional Medical Center while she called Melbourne Beach home, got her big break at the Melbourne Square mall.

She entered a modeling contest which led to the opportunity to work at Elite modeling agency in New York.
