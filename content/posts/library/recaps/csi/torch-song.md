## Synopsis

When a fire breaks out at a Las Vegas nightclub, it's every man for himself, resulting in multiple deaths not from the fire itself but from the escaping mob and smoke inhalation. Among the dead include two band members (front man and bass player), a white 18-year old Kevin, and a young Latino man named Timo Pedia. The kicker? The band is a white supremacist hate core band: White Rising.

Timo was killed in the storeroom at the club before being dumped in the dance floor.

The fire was set intentionally, initially thought to be via a cardboard box doused in gasoline with a candle as a timer. Hodges traces the cardboard back to Lee Wong Automotive, which surprises Nick, as Brass recently worked a case where Lee Wong Jr. was beaten into a coma when 'White Rising' played at the club before. Nora Wong explains that she and her friends had made Sky Lanterns for Lee, and the evidence is from months ago.

Part of the reason the fire was so bad was that a car was blocking the door. This car was used by Caleb Voight (borrowed from a minion in his skinhead community) after he killed Timo. While Caleb didn't start the fire, he saw who did, and describes the shirt worn by the John Doe who survived the fire, but is now on life support: Ian Baxton, a serial arsonist for hire.

Baxton had been hired by the club owner, who hasn't able to keep the club afloat.

## Review
