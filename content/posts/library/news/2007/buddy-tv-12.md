Though Sara Sidle has already left "CSI", fans of the forensic drama are still determined to convey their support to her portrayer, Jorja Fox.

Previously, fans combined their efforts to come up with a "Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign" to prevent the 39-year-old actress from leaving the show. When Fox officially exited the CBS series, the excess money raised by the crusade was donated to charity. And now that the campaign is over, a new drive is being created that aims to thank the former "CSI" actress.

"Thanking Jorja" is the latest gesture of gratitude instigated by the Fox's fans. Instead of sending messages to CBS about Fox leaving "CSI", her supporters are now participating in a letter-writing campaign that invites fans to send stories and photos to be included in a scrapbook for the actress. The project also encourages fans to share stories about how they came to know Fox, how she has inspired their lives, their favorite "CSI" episode she was in, and other stories that express their appreciation for the actress.

Fox, who left the show after seven yeas of playing the forensic scientist, is presently enjoying her break from the commitment of a weekly television series but also fears that quitting the hit series might be "the biggest mistake of her life."

"I've been thinking about leaving for a year and a half. I had to get up the courage. Maybe I'm just having a midlife crisis. Maybe this will be the worst decision I ever make," Fox told the New York Post.

"Theater is one of my loves, so I'm open for that after 11 and a half years of working in primetime TV for "ER", "The West Wing" and "CSI". I've never been to college, and I think about that. But I kept putting it off, and I am also thinking about having a child, and that's really important. Also, I want to do a lot of traveling and surfing - two of my hobbies. I have a one-woman little play about Dusty Springfield opening February 2 at the Renberg Theater in Hollywood," Fox added.
