First up, JAA is <i>this</i> close to the $1000 in 30 days they were hoping for. At $972 they're doing an amazing job for Burma

Second up for JFO, we're nearing $500 but we have another month to go. At $450, it ain't chump change for Animal Acres.

And finally, our webmaster's day-job is matching fund for hurricane relief in Burma, and she's getting her office mates to drop some moolah for that as well. Total amount undisclosed since she's taking the day off for her birthday.
