It's not a wetsuit! Jorja was at the award gala last night with Wally Langham. Actually I think the outfit was intended to make us think about that.

Check out the 81 images in the **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/benefits/20131030-oceana">Oceana Award Gala Gallery</a>**!

The <a href="http://partnersaward.org/">Oceana Partners Gala</a> was for philanthropists, ocean advocates and concerned celebrities, to bring awareness to the problems in our oceans. Also in attendance was Ted Danson, who shares some of Jorja's passions about a cleaner, greener, earth.

There are also images from <a href="http://www.patrickmcmullan.com/site/event_detail.aspx?eid=45547&amp;page=2&amp;pgSize=64&amp;sortdir=DESC">PMC</a> that I don't have an account for, so I can't get for you. Sorry. (If anyone does have one and wants to share, email me at webmaster AT jorjafox.net please and thank you.)
