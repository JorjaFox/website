"One of the keys to having a great life is to get involved in things that you care about."

Remembering her own experiences as the loved one of a cancer victim, Fox is enthusiastic about what funds raised at the Race can accomplish. "The Komen Foundation has a tremendous amount of empathy, wisdom and guidance to offer people," says Fox. "They're an incredible resource."
