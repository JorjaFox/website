The show follows the cases of the Crime Scene Investigation division of the Clark County (Nevada) Sheriff's Department, usually referred to by officers as the "Las Vegas Crime Lab." The division solves crimes almost entirely through the means of forensics evidence, which may or may not come to the conclusion of a murder or accidental death. Keeping in theme with the setting, investigations often lead to taboo subjects, such as sexual deviations. The bizarre conclusions of these cases often force one to question morals and beliefs and possibly human nature in general.

The show was given a sequel in 2021: _[CSI: Vegas](/library/actor/csi-vegas/)_

## Character

Jorja Fox plays Sara Sidle, who hails from San Francisco, and was brought in by personal request of CSI Supervisor Gil Grissom to investigate the shooting (and subsequent death of) Holly Gribbs. Since then, Sara remained on the team and proved her worth while solving crimes. Sidle's relationship with many of her teammates is contentious and layered, as she does not often open up to them. Sara doesn't really have any friends or interests outside of work, which can occasionally cause problems; she can also be obsessive about certain types of cases.

Over time, her relationship with Grissom develops into one of romance, which suffers a setback when, after being kidnapped by a serial killer and nearly dying of exposure, Sara leaves Las Vegas. Sara returns briefly to mourn the death of Warrick Brown, but leaves for Costa Rica. Grissom comes after her when, shortly there after, he too leaves the lab. After a year away, Sara returns yet again, married to Grissom, although he remains in Paris while she works in Las Vegas. Their relationship suffers from the distance and they end up divorcing.

In the series finale, Sara is promoted to Lab Director following a convoluted and deeply personal case which brings Grissom back to Las Vegas not for her, but for Lady Heather. However when Grissom confesses his love for Sara to Heather, she gives up Las Vegas to be with him.
