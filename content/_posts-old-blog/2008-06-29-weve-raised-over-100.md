With just over half a day left, we're there.  Astounding!

I want you all to take a moment and say 'I rock', because in the span of three months, you guys raised over $1000 for JAA's Burma 'It Can't Wait' fund, as well as JFO's Animal Acres 40th Birthday for Jorja.  Think about that power of fandom for something other than a new iPhone or a video game.  We did something for the world, expecting nothing more than the good feeling.

That's the kind of social action that inspires us to make the world a better place.  We are all better people for doing this and I'm terribly proud to be associated with all of you! I'm in talks with Animal Acres right now to do the donation in a way that honors you guys as well as Jorja Fox.
