**CSI  the series that makes forensic science look sexy  wraps a very successful second season. Bring on the spinoff and the next victim ...**

With the two leads set, casting centered on a trio of supporting characters, a veritable neo*Mod Squad* of sexy, edgy forensics flunkies. As criminalist Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox, thirty-three, a bohemian type whose backstory includes recurring roles on *ER* and *West Wing*, would be the neoPeggy Lipton. Gary Dourdan, thirty-five, a Meisner-trained Philly native who got his start on *A Different World*, landed the part of sly Warrick Brown; in Pleather jackets, "War" looks as groovy as Linc. And *Savannah's* George Eads, also thirty-five and a former public relations major from Texas who could pass for a navy S.E.A.L. (or a crew-cut Michael Cole), completed the triangle as hot-shot Nick Stokes.

And in a show where everyone seems to get along. "I've never felt closer to a group of people," says Fox  a good thing, since the group is usually exiled to quiet Santa Clarita, a residential town one hour north of L.A that pinch-hits for the Vegas suburbs. "It's a long haul," Helgenberger says. "There are lots of graveyard shifts and night exteriors. Everyone gets fried."

Fox, a Florida beach girl, is the "cool-but-sweet chick" who surfs and downs veggie burgers. And "I'm the mother hen, for sure," says Helgenberger. She's even been known to bring in pies for the cast and crew. "I'm not exactly Betty Crocker, so I don't actually *make* them," she laughs. "I just try to make sure everyone's doing okay, keep the spirits up."
