Well "CSI" fans, it looks like its official. Despite the online campaigns and petitions set up by fans to keep her around, Jorja Fox is leaving "CSI". TV Guide's Ausiello interviewed Fox last month and at that time, she refused to respond to the rumors about her departure from the series. Today, Entertainment Weekly has reported that the rumors are true.

Fox reportedly told "EW" that her decision to leave the show wasn't money related. She's just done being saddled down to a weekly TV show. She seems pretty confident that "CSI" will do fine without her, saying, "If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by."

Fox will remain in her role as Sara Sidle for five more episodes of "CSI" this season before making her departure from the series. Her last episode will air sometime in mid-November.
