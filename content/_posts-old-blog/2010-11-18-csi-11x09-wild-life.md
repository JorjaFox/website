<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1.2rem;">This is probably the last episode until mid December, if my spider senses tingle correctly. Also, while CSI is filming in Las Vegas, there have been no Jorja sightings yet. Finally? I'll update this tonight with screecaps, a recap and, maybe, just MAYBE, a video clip. Only if one's cool enough to want to clip, of course.</span>
<h3>Official Release</h3>

So it was cute. Three stars, mostly for getting to see a smiling Sara. That's so rare!
