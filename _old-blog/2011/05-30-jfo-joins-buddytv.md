<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/03/buddytv.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3244" title="buddytv" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/03/buddytv-100x100.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>You saw that new 'ad' on the site?  For <a href="http://www.buddytv.com/csi.aspx">BuddyTV</a>?  Well, in the grand tradition of WPAP and MaMa, we got sucked in too!

This changes .. nothing about JFO. You get the same news, you get the same me.  We just get pimped a little on their site (at the bottom where it says "News from around the web") and probably more traffic.  Which is fine.  They said it should 'improve' our search rating, but I just grinned.  After all, if you Google 'Jorja Fox' you get IMDb, WikiPedia and then JFO.  Personally I think WikiPedia is cheating, but that's just me.  We're number two on Bing, which basically means I could only get better if I bribed people.

So. There's that for you.
