Let's just put this out there, no one is more pro-GSR than Jorja.  The following article is from the Associated Press, and I cannot find a good link for it except [this one where they call her Jorga](https://www.digtriad.com/news/article/198438/204/Jorga-Fox-Wants-An-Episode-To-Reunite-Sara-With-Gil-On-CSI), so I'm posting it here:

WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a feeling of dread on the set of "CSI" and it has nothing to do with a murder. Jorja Fox says they're starting to shoot the episodes leading up to Marg Helgenberger's departure after 12 years. She says they've been on "this really fun high" since Ted Danson joined the show, but now, they're "about to be devastated." She says it's getting "pretty emotional" on the set. She says not a day goes by that someone doesn't ask Helgenberger to stay.

Jorja Fox says Marg Helgenberger is leaving just as "CSI" was getting to be fun again.

Jorja Fox says the cast isn't taking Marg Helgenberger's departure well.

Jorja Fox says she and Marg Helgenberger talk about her departure, since Fox also left the show for a while when it got to be too much for her.

Jorja Fox says if she could write an episode for her character Sara Sidle, she'd update fans on her relationship with William Petersen's character Gil Grissom.

I am very happy to see she thinks CSI is fun again!

Oh and the part you'll really like?

Ever wonder what's happening with Sara and Gil and their long-distance, practically nonexistent relationship on "CSI"? So does Jorja Fox. If she could write her own episode, she'd want to "look at her love affair more closely." She says "it would be amazing if she traveled somewhere kind of exotic to see Grissom and see what he's doing." She says Sara may be happily married, but "she's really lonely." Fox says they've starting filming the episodes leading up to Marg Helgenberger's departure after 12 seasons.

Interesting how different places pick up on different things...  This is basically 'Marg's leaving!  Let's talk about GSR!' which is adorable.
