This year happens to be one with the most LGBT TV charatcers ever. We do seem to get better at that every year, butÂ QNews, Queensland's only fortnightly gay and lesbian magazine, made a list of every LGBT charatcer in US TV, and did not forget Maggie Doyle.
<blockquote>**1997**

**"ER" (Series)**, Maggie Doyle (Jorja Fox) a Catholic doctor came out as a lesbian.</blockquote>
Of course, they get it out of order. Maggie Doyle came out before Ellen's "The Puppy Episode," which we know because Jorja was a surprise guest star at the end.
