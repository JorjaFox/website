Too many suspects on the first half of a CSI Double Header!

The "Nate Haskell Murder Tour" t-shirt was hilarious, and using the mini crime scene from "Built to Kill (Part 2)" was pretty epic. The episode eeks out three stars for Sara, but mostly will remain memorable for having a nearly Monty Python level of hilarious intertwining and twisting tales.

The recaps for "Hero to Zero" will be up in a few hours. The next <em>NEW</em> CSI will be Tuesday! Don't forget!
