While <em>CSI</em> executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Nareen Shankar were adamant about Jorja being in <a href="http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/07/29/csi-scoop-saras-back-is-grissom-next/">"five non-consecutive episodes"</a>, Nina Tassler – CBS' entertainment president – was just as firm in saying she was in the <strong>first</strong> five episodes, as reported by <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/CSI-Fishburne-Tassler-1008612.aspx">TVGuide.com</a>.  Then EW's Ken Tucker said on <a href="http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/08/03/csi-and-its-laurence-fishburne-problem/">Watching TV</a> it was six episodes, while IMDbTV <a href="http://twitter.com/IMDbTV/status/3109502771">Tweeted</a> that CBS had confirmed it was the first five.

At this point, I think everyone grabbed their head and groaned.

So what's the deal, I've been asked.  Does Nina (NOT Nancy!) Tassler not know what's going on with her hit show?  Were the exec producers ignorant of the scripts?  The answer is neither.

First off, only Ken Tucker has said this weird 'six' episode commitment, but since 9:30am in California, the buzz all over the net has been, indeed, the <em>first</em> five episodes of <em>CSI</em> will be graced with Jorja Fox.  While CBS has yet to release a public statement saying otherwise, the fact that Dustin Lee Abraham published a photo of Jorja in episode 10x02, and we know she's in 10x01, I'm going to guess that she's in the first episodes. Plural.

Will it be the first five? That looks very likely right now, and there may be more rejiggering of episodes to make that work. Nothing new with that, they've been doing it since season one! "I-15 Murders" was meant to be the second <em>CSI</em> episode, but after they decided to kill Holly Gribbs and bring in Sara, they had to film a new ep #2 and reshoot and redub a lot of the episode (which is why that episode is so weird). I would not be surprised to see a shuffle here.

So here's the summary: Jorja is back for <strong>five</strong> episodes, of which the first one is confirmed and the second is very likely.

Once they start filming the rest, I'll have more for ya!

<em>Edited to Add...</em> The <a href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/08/csi-fishburne-petersen.html">Chicago Tribune</a> has this to say:

<blockquote>The new season will have other changes; Lauren Lee Smith has left the show, and Mendelsohn said there is no casting going on at present to replace her character (though it sounded as that could change down the road). Because the lab is understaffed, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) will be back to work with her former colleagues for the first five episodes of the season. </blockquote>
