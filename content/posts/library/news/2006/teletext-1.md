*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* is the US's Number One Show and has proved a Global hit, including here in the UK.

What does it mean to star Jorja Fox, 37, who plays Sara Sidle?

"I've no idea" she gasps. "It's amazing we play in all but four countries in the planet and it's hard to process that. I just go about my life and sometimes people say hello, and that's a really nice feeling. It's a big compliment."

It's six years since Jerry Bruckhelmer's CSI began and it shows no sign of shuffling off this mortal coil. Investigations in season six have proved macabre, complex and glossy as ever.

"It does get harder and scarier to do that," says Jorja Fox. "But the sad thing is there's no shortage of material for the show. So many shows are based on real life. But I do think this season had some of the best script's we have ever done."

Jorja Fox says fans are in for a real treat with the finale of the latest CSI series, to air shortly on Five. "What we've tries to do is wake people out of their seats" she says. "I'm hoping that the 3 million folks in the UK who watch will have to pick their jaws off the floor."

Filming of the next series begins in August. "I think series seven is going to be about everyboby following their hearts," says Jorja cryptically.

One of the distinguishing features of CSI is the lack of private life divulged about the characters.

"I think it's a testament to the show that after six series most of the characters are still mysterious," says Jorja Fox. "And I really like that. I really like that it's been a slow peel of an onion, and hopefully when we do tell stuff viewers are excited about it rather than thinking they knew whatever it was already."

Despite only near flickers of chemistry, the relationship between Gill Grissom and Sara Sidle fascinates many CSI devotees.

"It is one of the bigger questions that people still want to know, which is great," says Jorja Fox (Sara). "It is one of my favourite storylines. I think for these two characters who live amid all the darkness, it's nice there's this stream of light. It's kind of a nice idea."

The CSI character who seems to provoke the most interest is the obsessive, enigmatic Gil Grissom, Played by William Petersen.

"We worked together a lot in the first two aeasons and became very close friends" says Jorja Fox. "He thinks he's nothing like Grissom, but I'm not so sure," she adds, laughing. "He is actually really funny but he doesn't have dry quotes in his head like Grissom does-thankfully."

Sara Sidle is a work of fiction, but Jorja Fox admits after playing her for six years, a synergy has developed. "The longer I do It, I feel we're the same person," She admits. "I feel she's an alter ego. We both have that OCD-Type A, focused and, like her, I can socially be a bit off sometimes. I love playing her I have dreams and hopes for her, but she's much smarter that I am I could never be a CSI."
