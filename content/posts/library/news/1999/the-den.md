Jorja who? No one really knows who the hell she is, but she's pretty hot, she's on ER, and that's good enough for UPN.

Jorja Fox, who plays intern Maggie Doyle on *ER*, is apparently doing her best David Caruso impersonation by leaving a hit show to take the lead role on the new UPN sure-fire bomb *The True Story.*

The show, from the creators of *Homicide,* Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, will be ready for UPN's fall schedule provided the two's escape from Betty Ford goes off without a hitch.

UPN originally ordered six episodes of the series for fall, but now it is just funding a pilot and six scripts because they are a bunch of sissies or are still digging themselves from the financial trench compliments of *The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfieffer.*

Fox will play Meghan, a medical intern, whose father is in prison for killing her mother. Meghan will also have a cop brother who will most likely be a tough non-practicing Catholic type, who "doesn't take no shit from nobody."

Aside from *ER,* Fox's soon-to-be-over career has included appearances on the "coming-out" episode of *Ellen,* and *Law & Order.* She recently completed the indie film *Tiara Tango* with Jean Smart. Also, Fox has had roles in the films *Jerky Boys* and the unforgettable *Feminist Warriors.*

Fox's last line on *ER* will reportedly be, "File that yourself, bastard."
