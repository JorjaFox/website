Twenty-five lions, most of them rescued from Bolivian circuses, are heading to Colorado to start their new lives at a wildlife sanctuary.

The 13 males and 12 females were scheduled to land at Denver International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.

Animal Defenders International say the lions were rescued from deplorable conditions after a law was passed last year in Bolivia prohibiting performances that involve animals.

Television personality Bob Barker financed the rescue. He and Jorja Fox, a "CSI" actress and ADI ambassador, plan to welcome Operation Lion Ark and offer the lions their first drink of water after they land.

The lions will be trucked to their new home at the Wildlife Sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colo., about 35 miles northeast of Denver. A 15,000-square-foot biosphere was built to help them adjust to the chillier climate.
