<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9125" alt="103885_d000810b" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/10/103885_d000810b.jpg" width="166" height="250" /> "Passed Pawns" — The CSI team investigates the death of a homeless man who had a huge winning streak at a small casino, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, Oct. 30 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. Peri Gilpin returns as Barbara Russell. Matt Davis guest stars as day shift CSI Sean Yeager.

Jorja _is_ in this episode, but only one scene ... and only if that wasn't cut. This is logical, since she was in pretty much every scene last week (yikes!). So because of the limited scenage, we don't have any videos at this point.

Make up your own reasons why Jorja's not in a lot of the episode, and spill them in the comments!
