**CSI Star MIA at ER Funeral**

On tonight's ER ? airing 10 pm/ET on NBC ? many ex-cast members are expected to return for the farewell of Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). Who? Exec producer John Wells has kept that info under tight wraps. But we can tell you who won't be there: CSI star Jorja Fox, who played lesbian lady doc Maggie Doyle from 1996-99.

"They did call a couple of weeks ago asking if Maggie Doyle could go to Dr. Greene's funeral," Fox tells TV Guide Online. "Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do it because I was working that day for CSI. They invited a tremendous amount of people who worked on ER throughout the years ? it's going to be one of the saddest shows on TV. I was sad I couldn't go because Maggie loved Dr. Greene!

"If I were free that day, I would've courtesy-called CBS," she wants to assure fans. "I don't know how they would've responded, but they probably would've let me go." Meanwhile, Fox just wrapped taping CSI's second season in Las Vegas. She looks forward to tonight's episode ? airing 9 pm/ET ? which introduces David Caruso and Emily Procter's characters, who'll be in the CSI: Miami spin-off this fall.

"Honestly, every time I think I'm over it, they remind me how disturbing our show is," Fox ? who plays lab-rat Sara ? hints. "Two upcoming episodes are the grossest ones we've had on. This summer break will be nice. I'll do things where the sun is shining, and I'm not going to be interested in dead people at all!"

So far, leading lady Marg Helgenberger has snagged most of CSI's awards show nods ? but has Fox any Emmy hopes for herself? "I'm so thrilled for Marg; she's brilliant," the 33-year-old says. "I would be a liar if I said I didn't have hopes for an acting nomination. Everybody does."
