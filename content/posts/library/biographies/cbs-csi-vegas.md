In CSI: VEGAS, Jorja Fox is reprising her role as forensic scientist ‘Sara Sidle,’ which she portrayed for 15 years on “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” on the Network. Most recently, Fox appeared in the coming-of-age film “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” on Amazon, and the John Suits sci fi indie film “3022.”

Prior to “CSI,” Fox portrayed Secret Service agent Gina Toscano on “The West Wing” and Dr. Maggie Doyle on “E.R.”

Fox’s film credits include Chris Nolan’s seminal film “Memento” alongside Guy Pearce, as well as indie hits such as “How to Make the Cruelest Month” and “The Kill Off.”

Her production company Seafox Productions has produced six projects to date: one full length musical about rhythm and blues legend Dusty Springfield and five feature documentary films that highlight the human condition and our connection to the natural world. Fox’s most recent documentaries include “Roll With Me” and “The Animal People.”

Fox serves on the board of the Artists and Athletes Alliance and is also an ambassador for animal-welfare organization ADI. Born to Canadian parents in New York City, she loves music, traveling and every beach she’s ever been on. Follow her on Twitter `@JorjaFoxofficia`.
