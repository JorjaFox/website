Two weeks ago, I had a lovely chat with the folks from Lion Ark (tl;dr they didn't know I'd moved West and wanted me to go to Wisconsin for the showing there). So while I did miss the local showing in my (general) area due to work, there are some screenigns you should know about.
<ul>
	<li>February 21-23 - Beloit WI at the Beloit Film Festival</li>
	<li>February 27 - Sedona AZ at the <a href="http://www.sedonafilmfestival.org/">Sedona Film Festival</a></li>
	<li>March 8 - Omaha NE at the <a href="http://www.omahafilmfestival.org/">Omaha Film Festival</a></li>
	<li>April 3-10 - Palm Beach FL at the <a href="http://www.pbifilmfest.org/">P<span style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;">alm Beach International Film Festival</span></a></li>
</ul>
These are the _only_ showings right now. I did ask about plans to distribute nationally, and they want to get it on TV if possible, but as a small film like this, it's really hard to get distribution.

_Which is why_ this year's birthday fundraising goes to ADI. Donate via CrowdRise at <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jorjafox46/">http://www.crowdrise.com/jorjafox46/</a> (or click the picture below) and the money magically goes to ADI no matter how much we raise.

And lest you think lions are the only ones having a good winter, there's good news on the HIBaE front as well!
