## Synopsis

Penny Garden, 65, is found smashed through a window and impaled on the glass in her house, with her nephew missing. The nephew is a recovering drug addict, and finds a miniature of the crime scene on his stoop the next day and brings it into Headquarters, which clears both him and the neighbor, the drug trafficker, who had been buying drugs from Penny.

The miniature scene is as exact as the first one, with the same photograph of a doll with a bloody forehead. They find evidence that Penny had been intended to die in her chair, but the overdose of nicotine she'd been poisoned with caused a seizure, and the miniature's creator had taken the miniature back to correct it. The CSIs manage to capture some blurry video of the miniature being delivered, giving the them their first look at the killer.

Greg is called to court, in an inquest from his accidental killing of a young man. After the CSIs demonstrate the situation to the jury, via Greg's perspective, the inquest finds the death excusable, but not justifiable. Greg is unconvinced, and the family serves him with papers for a civil case.

## Review

Catherine is sent to assist Sara on this case. Sara finds that Penny had been calling an unlisted, disposable cellphone number. Based on Grissom's examination of the miniature, Sara finds the drugs buried outside that Penny was selling for cash.

## Quotes
