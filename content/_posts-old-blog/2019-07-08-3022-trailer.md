<p>What we can tell from the trailer:</p>

<ol><li>Jorja is one of the still-sleeping astronauts</li><li>She's woken up (and has dialogue!)</li><li>She still has hope</li><li>She's smoking a cigarette (in space?)</li></ol>

<p>There's no information yet on when it'll be in theaters, but as soon as that's public, it'll be posted.</p>
