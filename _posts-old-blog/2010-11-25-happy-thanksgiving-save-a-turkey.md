While you're digesting your dinner, I have a suggestion.  Instead of Black Friday, or Cyber Monday, how about you give someone the present of life and a better planet?  I'm raising money for Animal Acres this holiday season, in the hopes of keeping animals safe, happy and warm.  Maybe it's just proof of humanity, maybe it's just because this is the right thing to do to keep the planet's ecosystem in check.

Donate to Animal Acres and help teach compassion to a world sorely in need of a little love.  And if you need some incentive, I have posted new <em>Missing Persons</em> screencaps and videos for every new person who donates.  Actually, I've done it for every person who donates (I draw the line if you decide to donate $1 every other day, though).  You get to help a great cause, and you get pressies!

<blockquote>"I am pleased to be a supporter of Animal Acres ANIMAL CRUELTY INVESTIGATIONS. Animal Acres investigators go to animal "crime scenes" - our nation's stockyards, factory farms, and slaughterhouses. Documenting what most of us don't want to see, their work uncovers blatant animal cruelties and is helping prevent animal suffering." - Jorja Fox </blockquote>
