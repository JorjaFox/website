The movie was filmed in 2009, which was eight years ago. Wow, how time flies!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/akammler">Amanda Kammler</a> worked on the movie _<a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/3-weeks-to-daytona/">3 Weeks to Daytona</a>_, and posted almost 200 photos of her time on set:

Whew! That was a lot of photos!

Massive props to Stacia for showing me the photos. Very much appreciated, sorry I forgot this in the original post!
