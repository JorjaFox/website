<h3>Official Release</h3>
The CSI team investigates serial killer Nate Haskell in Los Angeles. Langston becomes more determined than ever to track down Nake Haskell, the notorious "Dick & Jane" killer, after discovering that he's kidnapped his ex-wife, Gloria.

Well. That was interesting.  Sara and the science were fun, and Morgan Brody (nee Ecklie) was an adorable pocket CSI.  But the dragging out of the Ray/Haskell story is just that.  Dragged.  Out.  Also, expect the ratings to be terrible, because Callie and Arizona are getting married on _Greys Anatomy_ tonight.
