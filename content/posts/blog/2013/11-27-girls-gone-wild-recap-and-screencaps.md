Five stars, baby! While this was an episode _about_ Finn, it centered around Sara and she had the meatiest scenes. I mean "Who's Beyoncé?"

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/girls-gone-wild-recap-and-screencaps/beyonce-meme/" rel="attachment wp-att-9452"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9452" src="//jfo-static.net/wordpress/2013/11/beyonce-meme-250x250.png" alt="Who's Beyonce?" width="250" height="250" /></a>The one scene I knew would trouble me was when Sara shot (and killed) the deputy. After all, Sara said she could never take a life way back in season one. But when you follow the episode, and see how Sara knew the odds were against the sheriff believing her, and Darryl had already tried to rape Finn, _and_ there was a chance the whole damn town was in on it... Yes. She shot. She shot to save her own life. She shot after he shot. I would have liked to see more with Sara and Brass, maybe a bit about how hard it was, and if she feels guilty, but I'm okay with that.

It was nice to have the episode told out of order, and I loved seeing nerdy Sara, science Sara, _and_ action Sara all in one. Could have used more comedy Sara, but her awkwardness was totally believable.

No new CSI next week. And the week after, no Sara.
