**Stage fright:** Jorja Fox and Heather Reid are getting nervous, but it's more of that superexcited, can't-wait-for-people-to-see kind of nervous. On Thursday, they're hoping lots of people will see their new show, "Dear Bernard." It's an original musical the duo is presenting courtesy of Honeypot Prods., a grass-roots theater company they launched with a group of friends eight years ago. It's the biggest production yet and the first one to hit a real stage (the previous productions played to backyard audiences at the homes of generous friends, off-limits to agents, managers and attorneys). "We're both a little scared, like will we be able to fill the entire place every night on the weekend for four weeks," "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" star Fox says over coffee with Reporter at Large and Reid on Larchmont Avenue. "But there is a reason that it is our biggest show yet, because it's so great and a fun musical that has a lot of heart." Because of Fox's heavy shooting schedule with the hit CBS series, she's not taking a role in "Dear Bernard," only producing along with Reid, John Switzer and Katherine Kendall. Starring duties go to Reid, who wrote the entire thing from dialogue to music, inspired by the experiences of her own mother. It centers on Chelsea Mills, an English import who arrives in New York in 1973 only to become one of the biggest body-part models in the big city. "It is scary taking something like this that we've been working on for a long time and putting it out there," says Reid, who got used to stage life in her other career as rock goddess during her time in the Murmurs and Gush. "We think it's good, but you never know what an audience will think. The cast is great, though, and we got a lot of people to come out on their own and volunteer their time to help get the show off the ground." And off the ground it gets beginning Friday and running through Aug. 7 at the Court Theatre. Details: [www.dearbernard.com](http://www.dearbernard.com).
