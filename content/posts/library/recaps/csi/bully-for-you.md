## Synopsis

When the class clown at the local high school is found murdered, the CSI team is called to investigate, while Nick and Sara respond to the crime scene of a decomposed body found in a bag.

The student, who is also the top jock on campus, is found shot in the back in the school bathroom. The CSI team quickly discovers that the victim was also the class bully, and Grissom is convinced that he is looking for a classmate who was finally pushed to end the abuse once and for all. The team uses sophisticated new equipment to track the scent the killer left behind.

Meanwhile, Sara and Nick investigate a case involving a severely decomposed body of an Army veteran found in a bag.

## Review

Sara and Nick work the case of a liquified corpse found in a bag, which was shoved down a hillside. During the recovery of the body, Sara and Nick meet EMT Hank Peddigrew, whom Sara seems attracted to. Hank hits on Sara, but is repulsed by the smell of decomposition clinging to her. They eventually identify the body as that of an ex Army officer who was down on his luck, and arrest the owner of a nightclub for the murder. After several comments from colleagues, Sara showers with lemons (Grissom's suggestion) to get rid of the smell.

## Notes

* Sara meets Hank Peddigrew, whom she dates off and on for another two seasons.
* Part of the on-again, off-again flirtation Greg has with Sara, which she usually ignores.
* Sara throws up in the trash (because of the corpse smell, the first time she's done that.
