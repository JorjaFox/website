I found out Jorja Fox was a KCRW fan when I spotted her at an event we put on earlier this year called RadioActive. She looked like all the other music lovers, ready to get her groove on! The actress is perhaps best known for her work in the hit CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as well as roles on ER and The West Wing, but her love of music is clearly a major part of her life. She chooses a wide range of tracks for her Guest DJ set -- from big band and samba to folk and post-punk. Jorja returned to CSI for a story arc this month.
