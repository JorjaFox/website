Soon you have to go back to work and film the last bit of CSI.

It's heart breaking, I know. It gutted me too to have that be the end, and that be the way it was announced. Sure doesn't put anyone in a good mood.

But you know what? 2015 is looking like a year that has a chance to be better. It's inches and baby steps, but the world is changing a little for the better. It's a little better than it was in many ways.

You've done so much this year already for the world. You're at premiers and q&as for advocacy work that has opened many eyes, mine included, to what's really going on out there. From elephants to climate change to people caring for people to sharks, you keep making the world a better place.

Thank you.

Maybe next year, for your birthday, we can convince the Discovery Channel to air _Extinction Soup._

Until then, lets have some rain, some waves, some sun, and some dancing. Let's have some more happiness and joy in our lives.

Happy birthday, Jorja.
