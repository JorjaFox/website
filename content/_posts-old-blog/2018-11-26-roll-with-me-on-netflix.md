<p>You read that right. The film that chronicles&nbsp;Gabriel Cordell's amazing journey across the United States on his wheelchair is going to Netflix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of 100 days, Cordell rolled 3,100 miles though 13 states, starting in Santa Monica, California, and ending in&nbsp;West Hempstead, New York. He suffered&nbsp;100-degree days, 30-degree nights, severe shoulder pains, and several spills to the asphalt.</p>

<p>But that was easier than getting this documentary to the people.</p>

<p>Director&nbsp;Lisa France was a&nbsp;struggling LA filmmaker, thinking about giving it up for nursing when she learned about Cordell and his plan to cross the country in an unmodified wheelchair. One promo video and a Kickstarter later, they were on their way. It wasn't easy, as crew members struggled with their own demons, but they made a family and made it through.</p>

<p>The drama didn't end with filming, however. Even though Jorja Fox and Sharon Swart, a former journalist in Los Angeles, &nbsp;joined on as producer, they weren't able to get distribution. Relegated to the film festival circuit (where they did well), the next jump camp when&nbsp;&nbsp;Ava DuVernay's company, Array, picked up <em>Roll With Me</em> with an eye to releasing it on Netflix.</p>

<p>And that brings us to today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arraynow.com/roll-with-me">ARRAY</a> will release <em>Roll With Me</em> on select screens around the country starting in Los Angeles and New York on November 26 and on Netflix beginning <strong>December 1</strong>, just prior to International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3. This day honors the estimated one billion people living with disabilities worldwide.</p>
