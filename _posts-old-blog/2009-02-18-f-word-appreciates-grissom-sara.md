The F-Word (which is Feminism, in this case) blog contains the latest news of interest to UK feminists.  On February 18th, Bill Savage reflects on the "refreshingly non-formulaic" relationship between Grissom and Sara.

<blockquote>Grissom and Sara disobeyed the rules of heterosexual romantic plot development by never hating each other, then deciding they were madly in love and instantly getting married.

Obvious though this sounds when it comes to finding a compatible partner, itâ€™s amazing how infrequently we actually get to see it.</blockquote>
