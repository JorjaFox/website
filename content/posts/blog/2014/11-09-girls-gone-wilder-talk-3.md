Third time's the charm? <a title="“Girls Gone Wilder” Due Nov. 9" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/girls-gone-wilder-due-nov-9/">You already know how I feel about this</a>.

The truth is we're _all_ annoyed. I know I was super lucky to be able to see it when I did, and yes, I posted the caps a week early because... well I knew you'd want to see them. Also I was at a conference on Saturday (last for the year) and I knew I'd been dead tired. Hopefully for most of you this means you'll want to see the episode now. If you'd like to complain _effectively_ about this to CBS, please read my post <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/pissed-scheduling-drama/">Pissed About Scheduling Drama</a>.

**Spoilers**

Sara doesn't die. There is a gun pointed at her head, but you don't 'hear' the click you do in the promo. It's actually scarier the way they play it out. Well done. Also the last scene with Morgan and Sara will make you sniffle. Or want to hug them. Take your pick.
