If you're looking at the schedule, you'll notice there's no new CSI tonight.

If you're looking _here_ you may have noticed a new theme with a notice at the top telling you there are two new episodes next week.

Over a year ago (September 2013), I did a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/why-the-facelift-phones/">facelift to the site to try and make it work better on phones</a>. Traffic via mobile has only gotten bigger and the design is barely holding up to the problems of phones.

My friend Carrie made a theme that was mobile first, built for screenreaders, accessible, and basically all around good. I grabbed it and played with it, recruited my server buddy (who helps out here a lot on the back end), and here we have a new site design that looks, and feels, like the only one, while loading faster.

On the front page, you'll notice a pair of eyes peeking at you. Yes, that's Jorja. I'll be optimizing the gallery over the next few days, but we're all night and tight for 2015.

Something to admire until next week, when CSI wants to kill me with back to back episodes.
