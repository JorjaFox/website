<a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/090107/CSI/CSI-Petersen_l.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/01/csi-petersen_l.jpg" alt="Petersen in Chicago" title="Petersen in Chicago" width="75" height="100" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1335" /></a> EW has an article out with some final thoughts on Grissom's Last Days. Or really William Petersen's.  It's six pages of sniffling, and the spoilers are few (more like suggestions than spoilers), leaving many fans, wondering this how everything will end with Sara.  All EW says is this:

<blockquote>If fans were to follow the clues this season, all those private moments of reflection and despair suggest that Gil regrets allowing Sara to get away. But a scene in this season's fifth episode, in which Sara sent an upbeat video message intimating that her life was actually fine without him, could mean that his ex-fianc√©e won't be so receptive to a reunion.</blockquote>
