## Synopsis

The CSI team is called in when a famous real estate entrepreneur is found dead in a hotel elevator.

When the body of Bob Fairmont, the real estate developer, is found, the team discovers that the crime scene has been tampered with and that the victim has been re-dressed. After tracing the cause of death to a lethal poison, the team is shocked to discover that Fairmont's organs have already been removed and donated, making the case a bit more difficult to solve.

## Notes

* Sara has a bit of a germ phobia, at least when it comes to hotel rooms. This will be expanded in later episodes to cover all public places.
* Sara tries to bluff that she knows what 'Murder Central' means, when applied to a hotel room, but neither she nor Nick know.
* Sara gets frustrated when she realizes the murderers will get away with it.

## Quotes

**Sara:** No matter how clean or expensive the [hotel] room is, that's why I always travel with NonOxynal9.
**Grissom:** You sound like you're a commercial.

**Grissom:** What's the most important ingredient in a poison?
**Sara:** ... the poison?
**Grissom:** Patience.

**Sara:** _(places her hand on Greg's chest)_ I could really, really, kiss you right now. _(Greg turns his head away to present his cheek, and Sara leaves the room)_

**Sara:** What are we doing? Digging up graves, chasing prints...if it's no good in court, if the killers win --
**Grissom:** It isn't a competition. We don't 'win.' The courts are like dice. They have no memory; what works one week won't work the next.
**Sara:** I know that. I do. I know that. That's why I'm mad.
