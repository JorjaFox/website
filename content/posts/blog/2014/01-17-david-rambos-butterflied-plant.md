Ten years ago, "<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Butterflied">Butterflied</a>" aired and rang a seemingly death peal for GSR. In return, fans mailed the author of the episode, David Rambo, a plant. He kept it.

That's kind of sweet.

Oh and I know the JFO recap for Butterflied sucks. Rewrites welcome! It's from back when I was editing raw HTML to do that!
