<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Crime_After_Crime">Read the Recap</a> - I give it three stars, generously, based only on the scenes Sara was in.  It was pretty much a standard episode as far as that goes.  The crime itself was interesting, and I wad able to peg the real killer as soon as they told us that evidence was removed.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season12/crimeaftercrime/  ">Look at the Screencaps</a> - Only 87 screencaps.

If you think of Sara Sidle moments that deserve more description in the recap, leave a comment and I'll add it!

There is **no** _CSI_ next week, by the way.
