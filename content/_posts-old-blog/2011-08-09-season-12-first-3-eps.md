Massive thanks to the CSI-Mole who posts over on <a href="http://margamania.net/">Margamania</a>!  We have spoilers for the first three episodes, and number three is the one you want to know about.
<blockquote>**CSI 12.01 "73 Seconds"**

STORY LINE: A crazy, chaotic shoot-out on a hotel tram leaves two dead, almost no witnesses, and a lot of contradictory evidence; another dead man in Panaca County has a young man's face and an old man's body...

**CSI 12.02 "Tell-Tale Hearts"**

STORY LINE: The brutal slaying of an entire family has the CSI team stumped, particularly when an unlikely candidate comes forward to take responsibility for the killings...

Yolanda  Latina, a spitfire, an ex-Marine, she's now the ballistics tech...GUEST STAR. <em>**POSSIBLY RECURRING**.</em>

**CSI 12.03 "Bittersweet"**

STORY LINE: A sexual sadist walks free after getting a slap on the wrist by the system, and Sara makes it her personal crusade to put the woman back behind bars...

CALLIE late 20s, pretty, upper middle class grad student from the east coast, she's Doc Robbins' niece who is attending an art gallery opening with Nick. She reacts to the "trash art" pieces with intensely philosophical commentary that eludes Nick, but the two are getting along well -- until their date is interrupted by the discovery of a murder victim on site.

Gina enjoys playing cat-and-mouse with Sara, who is investigating the new disappearances, but despite Sara's best efforts to put Gina back behind bars where she belongs, Gina proves a wily antagonist who is very hard to pin down</blockquote>
Not entirely thrilled, personally, about the sexual sadist, but it's always nice to see that level of consistency from the writers.  "Oh yeah, Sara has a bug up her ass about this stuff!"  And it's not gender specific!
