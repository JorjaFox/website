## Synopsis

Grissom suspects murder when the body of a dwarf is found hanging from a rope high above a stage in a casino hotel where a convention of little people is being held. Across town, Catherine is attacked at a crime scene where a man was murdered during what appears to have been a home robbery.

## Review

Sara and Nick help Grissom on the little people murder, discovering how the victim was killed. They check out the victim's hotel room -- already taped off as a crime scene -- and find his fiancee (who is not a dwarf) in there. Sara checks the victim's computer, and finds emails from an online girlfriend -- which started the same day as the victim got call blocking against another woman. When they discover that the photo of the victim's Internet girlfriend is a fake, and is actually a feminization of the victim himself, Grissom defines attraction as narcissism. In the end they discover that the fiancee's father killed the victim because he didn't want his normal-sized daughter dating a dwarf and possibly having a dwarf child.

## Notes

* Sara once again shows off her prowess with computers.
* Sara shows no prejudice towards the little people.

**Sara:** _(smiles at Nick)_

**Sara:** Concept suggests... deep down we're all narcissists?
**Grissom:** Yeah. What attracts us the most is ourselves.
