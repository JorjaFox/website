"Backfire" — When the CSIs investigate a triple homicide, Russell has to find a way to connect with a 6-year-old girl who was the sole survivor and witness, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, April 10 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.</blockquote>
Jorja is not expected to be in this episode, but god only knows what's going on now. I'll make a post for the episode when it airs, since we just don't know anymore.
