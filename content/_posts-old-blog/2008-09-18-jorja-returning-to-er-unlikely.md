It's one of those things you can wish would happen, but probably won't. Noah Wyle is returning as John Carter and Anthony Edwards is coming back as the (deceased) Mark Greene.  Don't ask me how that works.  Edwards wants Clooney to show up but Exec. Producer John Wells isn't so inclined.  But what about our favorite gun-toting lesbian?  The Magic-8 Ball says 'Signs point to no.'
