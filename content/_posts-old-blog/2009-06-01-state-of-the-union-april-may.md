Before we get into the nitty gritty recap, I want to remind you that in 40-odd days, "Drop Dead Diva" will begin it's summer run on Lifetime, and Jorja Fox will be on an episode as a soccer mom with a criminal past. As soon as I have an airdate, I'll let you guys know. And seeing as they know when Tim Gunn's ep will air, they should have this already planned!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/ER">ER</a> came to a close and Jorja was seen in the second-to-last 'recap' episode <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Retrospective">Retrospective</a> (<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/er/season15/retrospective/" rel="nofollow">Screencaps too!</a>).  She also at made it to the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/events/20090328-er/finale_01.jpg">ER Finale Party</a>.

Jorja sent a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/?p=1771">Thank you</a> to everyone for the CASA donation made in Jorja's name, back when she left CSI.  She also made the yearly trek out to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/concerts/20090417-coachella">Coachella</a> and seemed to have a blast.  Green With Glamour made Jorja their Spring Advocate and had a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/model/200904-gwg/">smoldering photo shoot</a>.

Rumors of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/04/22/csi-the-movie/">CSI: The Movie</a> abounded, and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/04/01/william-friedkin-perhaps-jorja-will-return/">William Friedkin</a> thinks Jorja will be back to visit CSI.  Robert David Hall (Al Robbins the Coroner) called Jorja <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/04/27/robert-david-hall/">one of his closest friends</a> and hopes she'll be back too.

Jorja also made the list of <a href="http://www.peta.org/FeatureSexiestVegetarianCelebrity.asp">Sexiest Vegetarian</a> (results to be announced any day now) as well as keeping her standing on the 2009 AfterEllen.com Hot 100.  This didn't stop her from attending the Humane Society's <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/animals/20090509-casinoroyale">Casino Royale</a>, raising money to stop dog fighting, as well as Surfrider's <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/advocacy/20090520-bluenote">Blue Note Karaoke</a>, to clean the oceans.

Finally, we found out Jorja the political advocate snuck in another Artists & Athletes Alliance visit, this time for a briefing on <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/artath/20090429-obama100/">President Barack Obama's first hundred days</a>.

For someone who's not on a hit TV show anymore, Jorja sure is keeping busy!
