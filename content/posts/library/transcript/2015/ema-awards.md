**Renee Bargh:** ... Ah but first up we've got Jorja Fox from _CSI_. Hi, how are you?

**Jorja Fox:** You look amazing.

**Renee:** You love wonderful.

**Jorja:** Thank you.

**Renee:** You look great. So tell me, why is it so important to be at this event?

**Jorja:** I think it's one of the most important events that you could attend in Los Angeles. Bringing attention to environmental awareness, which is at such a critical, frightening stage right now. I'm super excited to celebrate _[Racing Extinction](/library/advocacy/racing-extinction/)_ tonight, I've had the pleasure of seeing it already. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen.

**Renee:** Really?

**Jorja:** Yeah.

**Renee:** Why so?

**Jorja:** There's a context that the filmmakers are able to sort of just put everything in perspective, and share it in such a way that you feel it cerebrally. You feel it in your heart, you feel it through your body. You just want to get up and do something. It's also a hopeful film, believe it or not. You don't leave the theater going 'Oh well. Everything's lost.' Which is great.

**Renee:** That's amazing. That you so much for being here. We're gonna let you get down the carpet, 'cause everyone wants to talk to you.

**Jorja:** Thank you.

**Renee:** But we'll see you inside. Thank you.

**Jorja:** Thank you.
