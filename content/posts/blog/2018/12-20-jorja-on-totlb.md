TOTLB, [Thinking Outside The Long Box](http://totlb.com/), is a pop culture podcast and in a recent episode, they talked with Jorja Fox about _[Memento](https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/memento/)_, _[Roll With Me](https://jorjafox.net/library/producer/roll-with-me)_, and a new movie!

Whaaaat? New movie?

_[3022](https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/3022/)_ is a SciFi movie and Omar Epps, Kate Walsh, Angus McFadden, and Sonya Walger. And yes, Jorja.

If you ask me, _Memento_ totally holds up, even though it's twenty years old, and the only part that makes it feel dated is the use of Polaroids.
