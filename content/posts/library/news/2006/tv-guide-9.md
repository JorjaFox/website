Holy schnike! The nookie is confirmed! While seeing a shot of Sara in a robe coming over to our dear Gil in bed certainly was no great surprise, it still made my heart race. I was kind of hoping the long, drawn-out pan around the room and the true answer to "GG + ?" would lead us to something more shocking (like Brass' daughter, maybe), but I'm happy to see this ending as well. A good handful of readers have said they would never watch the show again if Grissom hooks up with Sara. I've got one thing to say to that: I'll be looking forward to your posts next season.

No matter how you feel about the show getting personal, if you are a CSI fan, you really had to enjoy this episode. From start to finish, this was a classic. Just the first two minutes had me totally jazzin' for the rest. Before I could finish my cheeseburger (well OK, so it was a double) Brass gets paddled and we see a body with no head. It was a creepy yet riveting opening sequence. Top that off with a third victim and you've got what made this show great in the first place - bodies!

I relate in some weird way to that third guy who died of, well... sex, drugs, and rock and roll, I suppose. Music blastin' till 7 am, partying hard all night... I've always figured I was going to go out like that, too . except it would probably be sex with myself, Zocor and the latest Clay Aiken record. As long as I'm not found in my "I'm Aiken for Clay" T-shirt, I'll be sort of OK with that ending. I mean, who wants to die and have high cholesterol?

There were some really funny moments again in this one, too. When Dr. Robbins says the victim had sex in every orifice - the joke between him and Catherine was that he "died with a smile on his face, among other things." I thought Grissom and Sara counting off the 10 steps and dueling with cameras was kind of cute as well. What's not cute? A man in a corset. Having lived near Gettysburg for part of my life, I've witnessed a war reenactment before and they are really cool to see, but you just know that somewhere in the slew of actors taking part, there's got to be one guy taking the whole thing a little too seriously. Sort of like our decapitated friend.

Finally, how about those clues. Other than Gris, did anything else get addressed? If so, I missed them all. I got sucked into this photo frenzy last week for nothing. Well, except for the simple fact that I couldn't wait for this episode to begin. I suppose it served its purpose then.

No matter, it was an awesome ending to an up-and-down season. I'm looking forward to your comments expressing outrage over the last 10 seconds of the show, and I'll see you all in the fall when Season 7 begins.
