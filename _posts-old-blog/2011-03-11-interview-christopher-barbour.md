While he claims not to have a favorite character, he certainly writes for Sara really well!

My favorite part of the interview was this:
<blockquote>**Saunders**: That kind of segue ways into my next question: If Sara sticks around full-time next season, is there a chance we’ll get a little more backstory involving Sara’s mother?

**Barbour**: There’s always that possibility. I hope so. For our show we like doing a mystery every week and to find the right cases that will  illuminate our characters is always a challenge. I think you will see more of that [backstory]. I am not at purview as to who is coming and going, I just know that we are all close from actors to writers to crew. We all love working with each other which is really great. If Jorja should stay, we’ll definitely try to explore that backstory.</blockquote>
