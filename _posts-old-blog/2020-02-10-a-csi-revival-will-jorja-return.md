In somewhat surprising news, CBS is looking at a revival of _CSI_!

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">One of television’s biggest drama series franchises is plotting a comeback. I hear CBS is mulling a CSI event series to mark the 20th anniversary of the original series’ October 2000 premiere. The idea is for new installment, from writer Jason Tracey (Elementary), CBS TV Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer TV, to be set in Las Vegas and be a sequel to the mothership CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, sources said. The hope is that the new incarnation would feature original cast members. I hear William Petersen, who headlined CSI for its first nine seasons, and fellow original star Jorja Fox have been approached, but no formal offers have been made.<cite><a href="https://deadline.com/2020/02/csi-event-series-cbs-revival-original-cast-members-may-return-william-petersen-jorja-fox-1202854248/">Nellie Andreeva, Deadline</a></cite></blockquote>

This is of course all we know for now, but currently only Marg Helgenberger is actively working on a project on CBS (she's on_ All Rise_ as a lesbian judge). Absolutely no deals are signed at the moment, and it may all fall apart, so don't assume this is a go.

Who would you like to see come back? Besides Jorja of course!
