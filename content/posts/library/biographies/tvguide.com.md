* **Birth Name:** Jorja-An Fox
* **Birth Place:** New York, NY
* **Date of Birth / Zodiac Sign:** 07/07/1968, Cancer
* **Profession:** Actor

A former teen model who segued to acting with guest spots in after-school specials and evening dramas, Fox became a small-screen star with a trio of plum prime-time parts. In the mid-'90s she had a recurring role as a blunt doctor on *ER*&nbsp;who turned out to be a lesbian and - like Fox - a vegetarian. In a sly nod to her character's sexual orientation, the actress had a cameo on the famous 1997 "coming out" episode of *Ellen*. In 2000 Fox appeared on a different NBC drama as a Secret Service agent on *The West Wing*, but later that year she jumped networks when she signed on to CBS' *CSI**&nbsp;*as a dedicated investigator. Although the show turned her into a bold-faced name, behind-the-scenes bickering threatened to cut her run short: In 2004, she and costar George Eads were briefly fired during a contract dispute. Three years later during another salary standoff, Fox refused to show up to shoot the series' seventh season finale when she learned that her alter ego would be killed off. The episode was reshot with a more ambiguous ending. However, following her initial departure, Fox returned to the series regularly as a guest-star. Off-screen, Fox is an animal activist, noted for her work with groups like PETA and supports the non-profit farm sanctuary Animal Acres.
