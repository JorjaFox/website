At 4 pm ET, in Carnegie Hall, CBS will begin their upfronts.

Does that mean we won't know about _CSI_ beforehand? No. ABC is doing their upfronts on the 12th, but last night we found out that _Marvel's Agent Carter_ got a season two pickup (yay!) while _Forever_ died a final death (boo).

It's really sucky, waiting. But if you think it's bad for _us_ think about the hundreds of people who literally don't know if they'll have jobs and are waiting to find out. It's like a small company goes out of business every time this happens.

I think the odds are that we'll get a final, short order, season. If CBS has a soul. Which I don't think they do. I do think we'll find out today or this weekend, though. CBS has nothing to win by keeping it under wraps.

If it was me, I'd dedicate an episode to each character and then have a two hour wrap up. I would try like hell to get Billy back for the GSR ending (because it's so pivotal for so many people). An episode to handle if Finn dies (I'd kill her off, just because it's the end). An episode for DB to sort out his relationship with his wife. An episode for Greg to show he'll be the next Grissom. An episode for Morgan to make up with her dad fully. An episode for Sara and Grissom. The end.

And this site? No matter what, I'm not going anywhere. Jorja's an advocate and I bet I'll be posting about that for years to come.
