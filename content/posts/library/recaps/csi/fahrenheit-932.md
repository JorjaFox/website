## Synopsis

A man convicted of arson and the murder of his wife and child seeks assistance from Grissom (aided by Warrick and Sara) to help prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Catherine and Nick investigate the underground world of sports gambling when a teenager is murdered at close range.

_This was the first episode to air on Thursday night._

## Review

Sara is laughing at Nick's jokes when Grissom asks her and Warrick to work on a re-opened arson case. At the burned out house, Sara finds waterproof matches in the kid's camping gear. Sara also finds an unknown material burned on to the doorknob.

When Grissom is experimenting with gasoline in the lab, Sara pulls Warrick back, just before Grissom releases a controlled explosion. Sara brings in the piece of charred door frame and relates her findings; Grissom tells her the pattern is known as 'alligatoring', a word which Sara stumbles over when trying to say it. When Grissom is feeling a little down about the lack of progress in the case, Sara gives him a little pep talk, pointing out that 'any' hydrocarbon can be an accelerant.
