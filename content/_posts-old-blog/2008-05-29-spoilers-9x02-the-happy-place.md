Spoilers from <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/news/290508_01.shtml">CSI Files</a> below the cut.

<!--more-->

<blockquote>According to CSI Files sources, the second episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's ninth season will be called "The Happy Place". 

[...]

Sara is still in town, and she goes to visit an old friend, Thomas Adler. Thomas first appeared in "Too Tough to Die" during the show's first season. His wife Pam was raped, beaten and shot, but she survived. She's been in a vegetative state for all these years, and Thomas finally pulled the plug. He tells Sara he prayed every week for God to end his wife's suffering.</blockquote>

I will note <b>MY</b> sources are unavailable for comment, but they gave me the impression last week that Sara's two or three appearances will be in the premier, around sweeps, and at the end of the season.  I read that to mean 'two or three episodes', and I would like to revise that opinion to 5-6 episodes spread out over the season.
