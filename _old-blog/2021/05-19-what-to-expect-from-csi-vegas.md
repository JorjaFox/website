CBS has released a first look for _CSI: Vegas_:

From that, we can see the first case involves people messing with evidence in a chilling way. What if CSIs used their powers for evil, essentially. But there's bound to be more to it.

Also, while we cannot get a clear shot on Sara's left hand to see a ring (there's on spot it's not in a glove), I would like to note that we don't see any Grissom in the previews. Everything they showed of Grissom was early season one.

Theories anyone?

<h2>Transcript</h2>

**Jerry Bruckheimer: **We've been wanting to bring _CSI_ back for a long time, and why not? It's one of the most popular shows on television. We're so thrilled for audiences to take on this new season.<br>**Jason Tracey**: We're going to go deeper and showcase what's new in criminal forensics. I don't think we'd be brining the show back if we didn't have a way to leverage the epic run that the original had, against the characters that we all wanna watch.<br>**William Petersen**: I am excited to get back to Grissom again. The way we solved crimes twenty years ago is a lot different from the way they solve crimes now. It's a different world.<br>**Jorja Fox**: The bitch is back [laughter]. Being back on set with _CSI_ is more exciting than I even thought it was going to be. So Sara meets this new dynamic, intriguing, force of criminalists that are on the front lines, fighting crime in Vegas.<br>**Paula Newsome**: My character gets to lead these people... they're all like Michael Jordans in their field. We get to incorporate all that science, that takes us into the truth.<br>**Matt Lauria: **At the very end of the first episode, it's a gigantic cliffhanger. <br>**Fox:** With Bruckheimer Television at the helm, the show's going to be dazzling. <br>**Newsome:** The journey of the mystery and wonder ... it's exciting.<br>**Petersen:** The whole purpose of what the CSIs did was finding the truth. And I have to say ... it'd be nice to know what the truth is. Evidence doesn't lie.
