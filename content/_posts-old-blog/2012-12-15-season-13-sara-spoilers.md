I mean, I post 'em but I don't post the episode synopsis until CBS posts them because they change.

That said, I think you guys wanna know what's up in episode 15.
<blockquote><b>Episode 13.15 - Forget Me Not</b>
Things don't look good for Sara who's being indicted for murder. But Sara knows she's being framed and sets out to catch the perpetrator at his own game</blockquote>
