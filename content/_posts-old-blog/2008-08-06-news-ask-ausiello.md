Now that Ausiello is on EW, and it's Wednesday, is anyone surprised?

<blockquote><b>Question: Please set the record straight. Is Jorja Fox doing just the season premiere of CSI, or will she be in additional episodes?  — Shane</b>

<b>Ausiello:</b> I don’t want to give away the exact number, so let’s just say she’s doing two more than Gary Dourdan and seven less than William Petersen.</blockquote>

Gary is doing one episode and William is doing ten. That means Jorja? Has three. The original spoilers said she was doing three, and then it said five, and I personally started to wonder if she was doing ‘batches’ and was going to have three visits over multiple episodes. Having not seen all the scripts, I think we can say with 100% certainty that Jorja will be on CSI for three episodes, minimum.
