You know, our lusty celebs used to have bigger problems than choosing between Prada and Oscar de la Renta. Hard to believe, I *know*, but most every actor wannabe has struggled with a (lack of) cash flow.

Back ovah at the SAG Awards, I asked a couple of work-steady folks, who have maybe forgotten about their days o' struggle, what was the most bizarre thing they've done to get their costly SAG dues paid? **Jorja Fox**, you're up first.

"Now, *that* is a great question!" she exclaimed.

I know. Sure beats all that inane how-do-you-feel crap, huh?

Jazzed up in a white Spandex-y dress, the *CSI* looker-not to mention winner-spilled, "I had to pretend I was **George Eads**' girlfriend, and *that* was pretty weird." Okay, but really? "I worked at a kennel for a long time," she said. "That was probably one of the best jobs I've ever had, but definitely one of the more obscure."
