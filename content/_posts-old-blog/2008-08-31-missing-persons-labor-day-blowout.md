Happy Labor Day Weekend!  JFO is celebrating it with a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Missing_Persons">Missing Persons</a> marathon.  We've got recaps for almost all the episodes up now, as well as the final screencaps for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/missingpersons/parents">If You Could Pick Your Own Parents</a>.  Due to DVD errors, two episodes were unable to be recapped, and one is still missing.

A huge thanks  goes out to Rianne, for sending in the DVDs. A fun weekend was had by all, as I've never seen these episodes before.  Young Jorja Fox is a hoot to watch (her voice is so high!), and the show portrays a 'cop show' in Chicago better than many.  My intial thought was that Jorja has the 'sidelined chick' role, and as the show is filled with stereotypes, it works.  As a series, it gets a 3 out of 5, but most of that is becuase you can spend the whole show going "Hey! It's That Guy!" Even Chuney from ER shows up.  Living in Chicago, I recognized a lot of places and situations that no longer exist, and some that were gone when I moved out here, just over 11 years ago.
