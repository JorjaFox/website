Ads suck, but if you click on the ones that catch your attention, you're helping make sure I don't have to ask for money! Isn't that nice? I thought so too! Also, if you buy through the Amazon.com links off this site, I get a small percentage back (so get yer blue-rays through JFO!).

<h2>CSI</h2>
<span class="alignright" style="width:175px;">[polldaddy poll=2608686]</span> Since CBS airs college basketball for the back half of March, we only got two episodes.  That said, we did get some great video from the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/08/csis-electronic-press-kit/">CSI Season 10 EPK</a> (that's Electronic Press Kit) to share with everyone.  Oh and that vegasoul guy on Twitter?

There are eight new episodes of CSI coming your way, and CBS put out a video promoting them. Spoilers exist. You've been warned.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
The New York Times Sunday Crossword (often called the most difficult newspaper crossword puzzle ever) had Jorja Fox as an answer back on March 14th, and <a href="http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/book-binding/">Patrick Merrell</a> commented on it.  Eric Szmanda (aka Greg Sanders) talked to <a href="http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/Eric+Szmanda+Talks+CSI-77738.html">Female First</a> (a UK magazine) and said a truth we all know (having Jorja back is great).

Gerald McCullouch (aka Bobby the Ballistics Guy, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/ItsAHardG">ItsAHardG</a>) and Dustin Lee Abrams (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/vegasoul">@vegasoul</a>) put up a couple candid pics with Jorja:

Bénédicte translated an article from <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/23/the-ladies-of-csi-french-article/">Ciné Télé Revue</a> for us, as well!

<h2>Jorja News</h2>
Some more photos of the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/06/photos-from-the-hsus-gala/">Spotlight Humane: Chicago</a> gala surfaced, and David Masters (aka Nightwolf) posted <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/22/how-nightwolf-met-jorja/">his recap of meeting Jorja there</a>.  That's not your only chance to meet Jorja, of course.  In June she'll be working a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/22/jordan-vineyard-winery-event-with-jorja-fox/">winery event for the Humane Society</a>.

Finally the screencaps for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/03/24/forever-fabulous-new-screencaps/">Forever Fabulous</a> were updated, and then there were videos! Two about Liz's life and two about her bust and her boyfriend.

<h2>JFO News</h2>
Things were quiet, with just some tweaks to the layout of the front page and some Web 3.0ing of the rest of the site. There was an oddity with the wiki, and I know that not everything is Mobile Webified yet.  There's no good, public, wiki skin for mobile browsers yet, nor is there a way for it to work right in the gallery, but I'm still looking and working.

I also broke down and joined Formspring, so if you want to kick me a random question, <a href="http://www.formspring.me/jorjafoxonline">ask away and I will answer</a>. Unless it's lewd. I delete those.
