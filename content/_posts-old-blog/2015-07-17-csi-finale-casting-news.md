Grissom? Check.

Sara? Check!

Catherine, Brass, SuperDave, Henry, Greg, DB, Morgan, Hodges, Doc Robins, and Lady Heather? Check!

Wait... Go back one.

<em>Lady Heather</em>!?

There's a shocker!

But no Elisabeth Shue and no George Eads, which means I guess we know who dies.

Principal production begins on the 29th, so I guess Jorja's on a short vacation.
