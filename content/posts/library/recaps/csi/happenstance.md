## Synopsis

Identical twins, who had never met, nor ever learned of the other's existence are murdered when one twin plans to expose a photographer who had faked a Pulitzer winning photograph. Planning on killing one twin, he accidentally kills the other and winds up having to kill both, making one look like a suicide.

## Review

Sara spent the day waiting for her court case to be called up. It never was. Afterwards, she comes to Grissom's office, notices him reading the book Walden, fills out an answer on his crossword puzzle, and leaves, telling him she won't wait up (possibly indicating that she'll be asleep in his bed when he gets home).

## Notes

* Sara read Thoreau in college.
