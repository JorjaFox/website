The first one of the season is always hardest. Especially when you're not around this weekend. News on the homefront? My cousin's baby was born!

By the way, if you want a quick and easy way to keep up with the news, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/updates/">join the mailing list</a>. It will **only** email you when there's a new post here. No announcements, no spam, no nothing but Jorja.

Okay! On the the review!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/devil-db-screencaps-recap/vlcsnap-00106/" rel="attachment wp-att-8537"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8537" src="//jfo-static.net/wordpress/2013/09/vlcsnap-00106.jpg" alt="That Grissom Look?" width="300" height="167" /></a>This is a surprising three star episode, mostly because of that last scene with Sara in the lab. It was probably not a shout out that GSR was what made Sara suspicious, but I found it interesting that Sara had faith in the evidence before faith in the person this time. Normally Sara will fall for an abused woman's story, and in this case, I suspect her prior knowledge of Ellie (and how she acted to Warrick back in "Ellie") jaded her somewhat. Turns out that meme picture really was the turning point, eh? Also the bit at the very end, where the priest talks about eternal love, it was nice to see DB and Sara, both of whom are currently estranged from their spouses, share a look, as if to say "Maybe we should call..." Speaking of looks, the one Sara gave DB after he figured out Thebean Brothers (see right) made me laugh. It was almost a "Really? That Grissom look?"

How did you feel about the episode? Did you enjoy it? I loved the new credits (seeing Sara smiling is always a win), and the ending really surprised me. I was fairly certain I knew who was going to die, but I did not expect _that_ ending. Nice to see CSI can still surprise me, all these years later! I thought James Callis (the news reporter John Merchiston) would be the killer, and having it be 'people you didn't see until now' always is a cop out to me, because I can't make my own hypotheses without the evidence! But Ellie was a welcome surprise won a mild remark of "Well I guess Miniature Killer has a new cellmate in crazy town." As tragic as it is, Ellie was pretty screwed up and if the current 'only' man in her life fed her crazy, then yes, I could see this as a logical turn of events. I never really thought of Ellie as particularly stable in the first place. Murder? Sure, that crazy guy made her think it was nothing!

Here's a bonus picture for you:

I don't know, I thought it was a little funny... Maybe cruel.

My fondest hope is that it turns out that Merchiston _was_ the mastermind behind all this, and he's been trying to make D.B. crazy for years. Basically? I want him to be D.B.'s Millander.

Okay, enough of my rambling! Have at!
