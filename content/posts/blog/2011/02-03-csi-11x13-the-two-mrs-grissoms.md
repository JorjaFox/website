Oh and this guy you may know? William Petersen?  Yeah, he's here.  Gil Grissom will appear via Skype (kind of like Sara did in "Leave Out All The Rest").  GSR fangirls and boys, please remember to inhale and exhale at regular intervals.  Thanks.

By the way, instead of coming up with the best quotes, like I normally do on the JorjaPedia, I'm going to let y'all suggest them! Post your favorite Sara quote in the comments and if I like it, it'll make it in the entry!

<h3>Official Release</h3>
A night full of celebration ends with a bang when the director of a scholarship foundation for the deaf is killed by a deadly car bomb, prompting Sara to interrogate the students and faculty of the college where her mother-in-law works.

I .. I ... Right.  So yeah. There's that.  Watch this. 5 stars, no questions asked, and I'm going to go watch it again.  This time without having to pay attention for recapping.
