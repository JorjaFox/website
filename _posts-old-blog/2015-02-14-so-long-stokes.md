From <a href="http://www.people.com/article/george-eads-csi-goodbye">People Magazine</a>:

> So long, Nick Stokes. 
> 
> Sunday's episode of CSI will mark the end of the road for George Eads, one of the last remaining members of the CBS drama's original ensemble. 
> 
> Eads's decision to leave was reportedly an amicable one. In this exclusive clip obtained by PEOPLE, Eads appears with Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) – who started off with him on the show in 2000. Nick reveals that he's got an offer that's too good to refuse, but it will mean walking away from the friendships he's cultivated in good ol' Sin City. 
> 
> Sara reminds him that she'll only be a car-ride away – and she even brings her beloved Gil Grissom into the discussion to convince him that it's time to go. 
> 
> "You gotta go where you can do the most good," she tells Nick. 

We'll miss you. Interesting choice to mention Grissom.

By the way, the video is nonexistent for me. If anyone can get at it, ping me and I'll put it up where the rest of the planet can see it.
