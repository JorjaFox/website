**With a name like Georgia Fox...er...Jorja Fox, have you ever visted Altanta. If so, what did you like most about our city?**

I have family in Atlanta and I've been there many times. I have fantasies of living there, having a big old covered porch, and a little theater. I **love** the Reverand, Doctor King museum!

**What do you think of Southern men?**

I **adore** Southern men, simply adore ..... As long as they're very liberal.

**You've starred in *ER*, *West Wing*, and currently *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*, what is your secret for landing *gigs* in such incredible series?**

I really wish I had one. I do know if I feel nervous about a professional oppertunity it's usually a good thing and I should explore it. I was obviously a little nervous about all three shows.

**Which show have you enjoyed starring in most?**

It would have to be CSI. It's a fundemental leap into the "great unknown." And that's created an amazing, strange, wild, 150 member family.

**Is *CSI* ever based on real occurrences? Real Crimes?**

Sometimes. We try very hard to tell those stories with integrity.

**Which actors/actresses have you enjoyed working with most?**

it would be easier to try and hone in on who I've not enjoyed working with. I've been very lucky. I have a cerebrial crush on William Peterson. And certainly Martin Sheen and Allison Janey, are personal heros.

**What would be your ultimate role?**

I really just love getting to tell stories. I'd love to do a period peice, I'd love to play a revoluntionary, I'd love to explore mental illness.

**Please tell our *JEZEBEL* readers about Honeypot Productions and some of its upcoming projects.**

Honeypot is a zaney theater compant I'm in. We do stuff we've always just wanted to do, and things people might not pay us to do - theater under the stars, musicals, we did a dance piece - So far all our projects have been internally written. We have a new musical in the works.

**What do you enjoy doing on your "off" days?**

Right now I'm trying to surf - and learn how to play the drums. I have a car in L.A. (which I never had in New York) and I like to drive around - the west is **big** and new to me.

**This would not be a *JEZEBEL* interview without referencing fashion. Describe your current style? Favorite designer?**

Urban decay - I've always been underdressed - I try and I try - but I'm intrinsicly messy. I love Richard Tyler and Earl Jones.

**Which is your favorite section of *JEZEBEL* Magazine?**

I love to imagine what my nephews might be up to, so I love your hot shots section.
