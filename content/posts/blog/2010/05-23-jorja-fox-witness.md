Gregory Falk, in 2006, went surfing even though the Venice Beach lifeguards had raised the 'no surfing' flag. For those who have no idea what that means, if the lifeguards think there are too many swimmers, or the surf is too rough, they will run a flag up that says 'no surfing.' Falk disagreed with the lifeguards call and went in anyway and was arrested. That's not very abnormal. What happened next, however, is that he allegedly resisted arrest and was beaten up by the foot patrol. Which Jorja happened to see.

> Falk's chief witness was "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" actress Jorja Fox, who said she had come to the Venice surf spot just before the confrontation took place.
>
> She testified that she saw the police officers from the Venice Beach Foot Patrol handcuff Falk and "punch him in the face." She also said the officers "sprayed a substance in his face" from a distance of about a foot. Fox said she never saw any resistance from Falk.
>
> "I was upset by what I'd seen," she told jurors.

The jury rejected the claim of police brutality.
