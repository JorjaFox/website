*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* stars George Eads and Jorja Fox were fired from the show amid a salary dispute with the show's producers. Sources told Reuters Eads and Fox, who have been on the show since its debut four years ago, had approached CBS about a salary increase for the 2004-2005 season. CBS reportedly offered a modest take-it-or-leave-it raise, and asked the cast to send in a formal letter assuring the network they would report to work as scheduled for the start of production on the show's fifth season. It is unclear whether Eads and Fox had sent the letters, but both actors were sent a termination letter soon afterward. Sources said CBS brass stood their ground because of the growing number of cases where actors with contractual obligations to a show refuse to return to work until their salaries are renegotiated. Eads and Fox reportedly had two more seasons to go on their existing contracts.
