## Summary

Abbey keeps the staff busy with the fallout when she leaks her personal preference for a Federal Reserve Board appointment and discusses child labor on a talk show, prompting a Congresswoman to offer an amendment which could shoot down the entire international tariff bill; Charlie's date with Zoey is canceled because of threats by a white supremacist group.

## Review

Gina doesn't seem to care if Zoey dates Charlie or not.

## Notes

* Gina has the bedroom across the hall from Zoey.

## Quotes

**Gina:** You're looking at the girl whose job it is to jump in front of the bullet. I like it when she stays in her dorm room and watches videos.
