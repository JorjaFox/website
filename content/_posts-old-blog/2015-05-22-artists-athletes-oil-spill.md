This week there was an oil spill up in Santa Barbara, California, spewing gallons into the ocean and the shores in Northern California.

[Artists & Athletes](http://artistsandathletes.org/) held a briefing about this, which Jorja was in attendance.

This sort of work that she does is one of the many reasons I adore her advocacy. It's wonderful to see her and Marg out there.
