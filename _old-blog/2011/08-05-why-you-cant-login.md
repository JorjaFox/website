Because of that, right now, no one (but me) can log in.

This **does not** affect anything.  It just means you have to type in your name and email every time you comment, and you can't use the groups right now.  Which is a pain, because I really do like them, but ... I'm actually still not sure exactly what happened (the experts and I agree it's probably due to my shenanigans in 2009).  In order to get the site back up and running, I've brought it back to basics: a blog where anyone can comment.

Where we go from there is up to _you_.

Let me know how you feel!  If you guys think that I should just give it up, I will!  If you want to see something else, let me know.  At this point, I'm open to possibilities.
