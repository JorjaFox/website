Was that enough for you? Even CSI Files is clear that this should not be taken as absolute.

You ready? Okay the following comes to you from <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/11/csi-takes-a-detour-into-danger-in-girls-gone-wild/">CSI Files: 'CSI' Takes A Detour Into Danger in 'Girls Gone Wild'</a>
<blockquote>According to CSI Files sources, “Girls Gone Wild” opens with Morgan rushing through the lab searching for DB. She finds him with Nick and tells them that something has happened: there’s been a shooting, and Sara’s cell phone cut out. Finn isn’t answering her phone either. Worried, DB tells Morgan to call the sheriff’s office in Larkston, Nevada while he calls Brass to get him a helicopter.

DB and Nick arrive on a rural road, climbing out of the helicopter and heading toward a crime scene. The Larkston sheriff has been shot in the thigh, and he’s being loaded into an ambulance. His deputy is lying dead on the ground. Sara is sitting in the back of a second ambulance with blood on her face, but she’s okay. She was only grazed by a bullet, and she’s more concerned about Finn. She can’t reach her on the phone, and she’s worried that someone might have gone after her.

Meanwhile, Finn is stumbling down the side of a different rural road. She has dried blood matted in her hair and crusted under her nose, and she’s trying to flag down a passing motorist. A car drives by and stops, and Finn is relieved—until the car turns around and speeds toward her, slamming into her and knocking her off the side of the road.

Brass speaks to Sara at the Larkston sheriff’s office to find out what has happened in the past few days. The previous Friday, Morgan invited Sara and Finn to head to Reno for a spa weekend, but Finn’s car broke down on the side of the road. A handsome mechanic named Darryl said he could get the part to fix the car the next morning, and he drove them to Larkston to spend the night. They headed to a local bar to make the most of their night by having a few drinks and singing karaoke. Finn left the bar to spend more time with Darryl, but she rejected him when she realized he was married. Incensed, Darryl pulled out a knife and tried to force himself on her. Finn fought back, getting cut in the process, and she struggled until she got control of the knife to defend herself. She stabbed Darryl in the chest and ran back to the bar, scared and bleeding, to get help. Someone called the Sheriff, and Morgan and Sara followed Finn to where she left Darryl’s body—but all that was left was a pool of blood.

As I'm not the source, I can't really tell you anything about this more than has been said. I'm looking forward to this. It strikes me as something that will be either awesome, or camp-worthy hilarious (like "Appendicitment" was sort of weird in that funny way).
