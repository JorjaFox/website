Jorja's art is a signed photograph with 'Thanks for helping out the wolves! Jorja Fox' and an original poem.

The photo and poem will be for sale at the “Majestic Beauty” **live** auction (so yes, you have to be there in person to bid), to be held on Saturday, Oct. 23, at 6 p.m. The event itself is free, though not all celebs who donated art are expected to be there.

All event proceeds benefit the Wolf Conservation Center (WCC).

But you probably want to see Jorja's poem:

{{< blockquote >}}
**Wolf Life**

Standing on\
the threshold, like\
an astronaut or deep\
sea diver. I'm in the company of wolves.  And\
I'm amazed when you run like the wind\
my friend, you save us all from a\
soul less world.
