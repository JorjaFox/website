**Age:** 37.

**Significant others:** Just her two cats and a dog.

**Finest hour:** Landing the role of *CSI*&#8216;s Sara Sidle, straight after making the hit movie *Memento*.

**She says:** &#8216;There's no such thing as a bad day when you're going in to work with those guys' &#8212; on her attractive co-stars George Clooney (*ER*), Rob Lowe (*The West Wing*) and Gary Dourdan (*CSI*).
