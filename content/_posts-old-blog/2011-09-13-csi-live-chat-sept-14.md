<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3782" title="0004_CSI" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/09/0004_CSI-110x70.jpeg" alt="" width="100" height="75" />Every night this week, CBS will have a special 'live chat' for their fall line up.  CSI is set for 10pm ET on Sept 14th and our exec producers, Carol Mendelsohn and Don McGill will be answering your questions, live!  Remember, this will <em>not</em> be time shifted.  10pm ET means 7pm PT and the rest of you have to remember what time you are to that.
<blockquote>Go behind the scenes of Wednesday nights' line-up including Survivor: South Pacific, Criminal Minds, and CSI! Then, CHAT LIVE with CSI Executive Producers Carol Mendelsohn and Don McGill at 10pm ET/7pm PT.</blockquote>
Watch for it on CBS' Fall Premiere Site.
