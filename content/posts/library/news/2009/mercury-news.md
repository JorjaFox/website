This should make most 'CSI' fans happy: CBS has announced that Jorja Fox will be returning to the show for 'multiple episodes' next season, reprising her role at Sara Sidle.

'We're thrilled for Jorja's return to CSI,' said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. 'The viewers and longtime CSI fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode.'

OK, but when the heck are the going to bring back William Petersen?
