Yep, it's a real thing. The show's on for at least another season, though no official word on who's back (the odds are for everyone). There's also no news about what time CSI will air, but again, odds are the same time it's been airing for a while now.
<blockquote>The nine dramas picked up are: NCIS, television’s #1 drama/scripted program for the fifth consecutive year; NCIS: LOS ANGELES, the #2 drama for the fourth straight year; time-period winners PERSON OF INTEREST, CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, HAWAII FIVE-0 and BLUE BLOODS; as well as CRIMINAL MINDS, ELEMENTARY and the acclaimed drama THE GOOD WIFE.</blockquote>

I know a lot of people haven't liked the direction of the show, of found the episodes boring. Honestly I still enjoy it for what it is, though I've really only every watched it for Jorja so I skip most of the non-Jorja episodes. But that's more to do with Crime Drama burn out -- CSI isn't 'funny' and I like to chuckle while I watch a show. Which may be why I did like last night's "Long Road Home" so much. It was a straight up case, no one character got massive more screen time than another, the mystery was straightforward, and there was some funny and poignant. That's kind of what I've always expected from CSI, and I hope to get more of it.
