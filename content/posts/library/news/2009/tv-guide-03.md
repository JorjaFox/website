 For CSI fans, it was like hitting the jackpot when news broke that Jorja Fox will be rejoining the lab pack as Sara Sidle for at least 5 episodes next season-but what will viewers think when they see Grissom's main squeeze in a orange jumpsuit and cuffs for a guest stint on **Drop Dead Diva**? "I hope you are going to be rooting for me", says Fox, who describes her character as "a suburban housewife who's in deep hot water", Fox tells TV Guide, she "loved" being on the other side of the judicial system for a change: "It was really fun to play somebody in prison, it was a complete departure for me, as was the suburban housewife-I hope I pulled that off"! And as for heading back to Las Vegas? She's staying mum on what it means for her character and Gil, but hints that there are answers about her return to be found in the season premiere Sept. 24. "I think all I can really say [pause] is the team had a rough year. There has been alot going on and Sara comes back mostly just to see if she can help out for a while, because she loves those guys and she misses them" Right back atcha!
