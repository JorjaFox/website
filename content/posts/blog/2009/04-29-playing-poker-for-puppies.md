Actually they call it "Casino Royale: Playing for Change" and on May 9th, Jorja Fox is expected be at the casino event for the official kickoff of The HSUS's "End Dogfighting in Los Angeles" campaign.  There's no word (yet) on if she's <!-- playing poker or not, and right now only <a href="http://hslf.typepad.com/political_animal/2009/04/deal-dogs-a-winning-hand.html">Mike Markarian is confirming Jorja's attendance, --> attending, but it sounds like a Jorja thing to do.
