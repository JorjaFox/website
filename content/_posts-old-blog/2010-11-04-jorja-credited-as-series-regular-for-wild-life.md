Okay. What does this mean? Well ... I'm not sure. It means I have to watch every episode, for sure, but it doesn't really tell us anything we didn't know, which is 'she's a member of the main cast.'  Billing and listing negotiations confuse everyone, so one possible option is that CBS has screwed up all their press releases up till now. Or they're messing it up now.  Can't say for sure.

At this point, I'm cautiously optimistic, though.

(Dear Jorja, for Hanukkah, could you get your contract sorted out and email me? Love, Ipstenu!)
