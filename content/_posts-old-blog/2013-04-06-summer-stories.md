First up is a skimpy article by Ken Tucker from 1992, which is simply a review in <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly_(13_March_1992)"> Entertainment Weekly of Summer Stories: The Mall</a>. Oh yes, she was 'Jorjan' back then.

She's also Jorjan in this photo, watermarked alas, that was released around the time the episode aired.

Don't judge them, it was 1992.
