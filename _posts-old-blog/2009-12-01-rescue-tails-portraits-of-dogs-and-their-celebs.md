<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/puppy.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/puppy-100x100.jpg" alt="puppy" title="puppy" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2135" /></a> The love between dogs and their people is a bond so exceptional it can be hard to put into words. So Brian Nice uses photographs instead -- nearly one hundred and fifty beautiful portraits of noted celebrities with the special dogs they love -- in a book that will delight both your eyes and your heart. The pictures and the quotes that accompany them are tributes to the countless ways a dog can make any person's life special, and Brian Nice has caught his celebrity subjects (both human and canine) as you may never have seen them before: relaxed, goofy, blissfully happy, and completely in love with their four-legged friends.

Brian Nice's own pug, Buster, whose enchanting photo graces the cover, is the inspiration for the book. After Buster was saved from blindness by a doctor recommended by the Humane Society of New York, Brian wanted to do something in return. This book is a special gift of thanks to them, and the author's proceeds will go to benefit both the Humane Society of New York and Much Love Animal Rescue in Los Angeles, both no-kill animal shelters.

A very special book about some very special dogs, _Rescue Tails_ is a book to treasure, reminding us each and every day not only how much love and happiness dogs give us, but also what we can do in return, and of the opportunity we all have to make a difference in a dog's life.

You can read more about it at <a href="http://www.pose4paws.com/">Pose 4 Paws</a>, and purchase this for between $20 and $15 US from pretty much any on-line book store from Amazon to Borders and beyond. Buy the book, admire Jorja and Ali (her Boxer) and save some lives.

Updated to add in how pretty Jorja and Ali are!
