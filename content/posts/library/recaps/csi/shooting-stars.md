## Synopsis

A fairly straightforward case, in so far as they go. After dumping they body of Ty Bently in someone's yard, a dozen of unwashed cult members retreat to their compound and eleven of the twelve die by ritual suicide (spiked vodka) to ascend via the mother ship during the [http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html Orionid meteor shower].

The cult members broke into the house by slashing the screen door, and proceeded to raid the fridge for junk food. They dumped Ty in the hard, who had numerous broken bones, and killed the dog with the same Ketamine they took later during the peak of the meteor shower. The cult was run by Joseph Diamond, who made a habit of luring impressionable young college students to his side, using sex with the woman (and possibly the men). The FBI had been keeping mild tabs on him for years, but generally he'd drug the kids and steal their money (which they'd written home for) and they'd wake up broke with a hangover.

This time, the base was at an abandoned military observation bunker in the desert. Ty's ex, Emma, was a cult member, and he had recently argued with Diamond about Emma. Diamond was planning a one person, one way trip to Australia, presumably to take the act someplace new. One of the cult members, Abigail Spencer, catches on to Diamonds cut and run plan. Even though he invites her along, she sees it as a test and kills him.

Abigail then uses her knowledge from her former job to steal enough Ketamine to spike everyone's vodka and kill them. When Ty shows up to get Emma back (and call the cops on the mess), it's Abigail who shoves him the 80 feet down the bunker to his death, and convinces the cult to dump the body where he'll be found. Then she spikes the drinks and watches everyone die. Even though she wanted to join the others in rapture, she seems to realize that there is no Mother Ship, and runs away home without drinking.

When the cops come, however, Abigail gets scared and runs off, taking the leftover Ketamine in a last ditch attempt to kill herself. She's saved by Brass and LVPD, and confesses all to Grissom. After Abigail asks if Grissom believes in life 'out there,' he tells her that if there is, they're smart enough to stay away from humans.

## Review

Yet another low-key Sara episode; she plays assist and little more. At the scene she dusts the refrigerator for prints. She goes through the prints collected with Mandy, and later has a brief chat with Brass about Jim Diamond and cults.
