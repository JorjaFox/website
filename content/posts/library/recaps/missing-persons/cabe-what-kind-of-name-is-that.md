## Synopsis

A two year-old named Caleb (which Ray mishears as 'Cabe') is found wandering alone in a forest preserve. Ray and Barbara take him home until Carlos can find the parents. Bobby is assigned a missing 19 year old Phillipino who is embroiled in gang-related narcotics trafficking. Connie looks for a mysterious philanthropist, Mr. Hodgekiss. who suddenly disappeared while out for his nightly constitutional. Johnny gets dead body detail. He has to identify a homeless person found face down in an alley. A strange coincidence ends up uniting Connie and Johnny.

## Review

Connie brings in donuts to the office and while admiring the pictures of Carlos' newborn son, is asked when she'll have a child. Connie deflects the question, saying maybe when she makes Sergeant. Ray gives Connie a case of her own, looking for a missing philanthropist on Astor Street. While waiting for the maid to bring tea, Connie entertains herself by playing Mozart on the piano. The maid explains that Mitchell Hodgekiss became a recluse after his family died in a plane crash, only leaving the house for his evening walks.

Hodgekiss' new doctor flirts with Connie, preferring to treat her chauvinistically, regardless of the fact they're both married. As the doctor has never actually treated Hodgekiss, however, Connie leaves and declines the doctor's offer of an affair. The lawyer, Mr. Perkins, explains Hodgekiss had survivor's guilt, and was a philanthropist in order to apologize for outliving his family. With no clues, Connie asks Ray for help who reminds her that she can't just send details to the morgue via interoffice mail, and she goes down to make sure the data was imported. Johnny finds the missing man in the morgue, who turns out to have been masquerading as a homeless street musician, who played every night for children and giving money away. Connie manages to match the dental records to combine the cases.
