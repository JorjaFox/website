If you watch "CSI" at all, then you are likely aware of Jorja Fox's reported contract difficulties. At the end of this past season, viewers were left with an image of her character, Sara Sidle, trapped under a wrecked sports car in the middle of nowhere. Signs of life were, shall we say, limited.

The bigwigs at CBS are quick to point out that [Jessica] Lucas' character is a **new edition**, not a **replacement** for Jorja Fox. The question is, do we believe them? I for one, have my doubts. Sara might very well survive that car crash, but does that mean she'll stick around in Vegas? Who knows. I do know at least one thing for sure. The legions of femslash writers out there are likely to ignore Sara's death (if it happens) just as they have ignored her on screen romance with Grissom.

And frankly, much as I enjoy Jorja Fox and the character of Sara Sidle, if the character's death would prevent me from having to see Sara and Gil making doe eyes at each other and getting all snugly, then so be it. I have not been able to properly watch an episode of "CSI" since Sara walked into Gil's bedroom in a bathrobe. The very last bedroom I wanted to see Sara walk into in a bathrobe is one with Gil Grissom waiting on the bed. Perhaps my own fascination with femslash has done something to my brain, but the idea of Grissom and Sara romancing one another disturbs me. I honestly walked around the house after the big reveal mumbling, "My eyes. Oh, my eyes."
