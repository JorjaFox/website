The Wiki has been retired and replaced with a much simpler tool. If you can't find something, let me know. It's probably there (almost everything is) and I tried to make the layout logical.

<h2>Where are the episode recaps?</h2>

They're in two places. First, if you just want recaps, check out the page that links to all the TV recaps. It's conveniently called... <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/recaps/">Recaps</a>. But if you happen to click through the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/filmography/">Filmography</a> you may notice that the items are linked. If it's a movie, the recap is on the movie page. If it's a TV series like <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/csi/">CSI</a> then when you scroll to the bottom of the page, there's a see also with a link to the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/csi-episodes/">List of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episodes</a>.

One page for all the episodes. Every episode linked off that page.

<h2>Where are the news articles?</h2>

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/news/">In the news section</a> of course! All articles were imported.

<h2>Where are the interviews?</h2>

They're under <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/">Transcripts</a> because they include online chats too.

<h2>Did you know the search at the bottom of the page is broken?</h2>

Yeah, I know. I'm working on that right now, but since it's the only thing that isn't working right, and about ten of you actually used it, I felt it was safe to switch over.

<h2>Is everything done?</h2>

Almost all the _content_ is imported. There are 16 pages that I still have to pull in, but they were weird one-off pages that weren't linked anywhere. Also there are still some layout and design tweaks to be made, like at the top of the TV show pages. I want to make that prettier and less of a list, but the content is there.

<h2>I think you should....</h2>

Leave a comment. :) Seriously I'd love to hear about ways to make it better.

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

Two main reasons.

First, the code that ran the Wiki was becoming too cumbersome. I was spending more time applying fixes and re-learning technical tricks only to have them replaced with poorly documented examples that weren't tech friendly. The final straw was when the project started to make noise about a change in direction. Basically it was too big and complex and annoying. The replacement is a static file generator called Jekyll, which was incredibly weird and technical to setup, but it outputs plain HTML. This means it's _faster_ for you to read on your phones. Since that part of the site is the most popular to mobile devices, it was a win-win.

Second, it's easier to cross link everything. What you can't see is that there's a data file with all the episodes, the star rating, and the short blurb on the episode. That file generates the star rating for the episode everywhere it shows up. When I make the new episode pages, it gets populated automatically. Before, I was doing all of that manually. This is way better for me. Even if Jorja's not on a TV show anymore. It also made pages like the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/">Advocacy</a> page much easier. I just make a new page in that section and it gets linked properly.

And a sneaky third... I love learning new things.
