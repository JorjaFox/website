GSR Fan Kristen Elizabeth titled her review <a href="http://www.tvequals.com/2013/01/17/csi-season-13-review-dead-air-just-argh/">Just ... ARGH!!</a> and I think that sums it up.
<blockquote>But…and this is key…that plan should make sense for the characters. At no point should the audience feel that the writers have forgotten the character’s core traits or the history that has shaped them, and in all honesty, sometimes I think the writers forget just how strong Sara is and how much she’s overcome in her life. I mean, last season they forgot she had a brother, remember? Doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. While it’s true that Sara has tender spots, they should never be mistaken for weakness. She was never afraid to confront Grissom about their relationship when they were on much shakier ground; why has that suddenly changed now that they’re married?</blockquote>
