For three years, CSI investigators Sara Sidle (played by Jorja Fox, 34) and Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan, 37) have worked side by side, exchanging polite professional words. But at the People's Choice Awards on Jan 11, the actors Fox and Dourdan snuck off repeatedly to hold hands and share smokes. The couple was spotted kissing by several backstage guests. 'They couldn't keep their hands off each other,' a backstage photographer tell Star. Hmmm, looks suspicious. Dourdan's publicist, Jerry Weinman, tells Star , 'They're co-stars on TV's number one show and sure, they've friends, but that's all. That's as far as their affection for each other goes.' Maybe..maybe not. Twice, an eyewitness tells Star, a handler at the event had to step in to tell the couple to stop touching each other. We're not going to call this case closed, but as they say on CSI, 'The evidence never lies.'
