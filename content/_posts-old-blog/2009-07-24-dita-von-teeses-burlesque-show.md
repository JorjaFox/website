Think of Gypsy Rose Lee and nod a lot to pretend you understand the 1950s titillation over a tummy shot, while running around in your halter top and short shorts.  There's a get off my lawn comment here, and I admit that as I'm in my 30s, my knowledge of burlesque comes from my family, who used to make costumes for those ladies.

Dita Von Teese did burlesque at the Avalon in Hollywood, and is still there right now, giving a classing, old-school show to a crowd of newbies to the genre. While the article is safe for work, and young kiddies, burlesque itself is best appreciated by the 18+ crowd. 

And yes, Jorja was there:
<blockquote>There were multitudes of celebrities in the audience: we spied Margaret Cho and Jorja Fox, (of CSI: Las Vegas), as well as Jenny Lewis (or at least her exact replica).</blockquote>
