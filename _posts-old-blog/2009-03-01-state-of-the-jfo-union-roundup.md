I'm going to try to do this every month, just to keep people in the loop with the site, Jorja and everything else related!

**Jorja**
Basically, Jorja's doing charity and advocacy right now, for human rights, animal rights and the like.  This means that news, real news, is hard to find.  Huge kudos go to Amethyst, Ricker and everyone at JAA.  Without all those eagle eyes, I'd never be able to find everything quite so fast.

I've got no rumors about Jorja being on ER's last episodes, and at this point it may be a lost cause. They should be done filming soon, if they aren't already, and once they bust out to tell us Doug and Carol are coming back, there's no point to hide Doyle.  Meanwhile, Dusty Springfield is still a maybe for Chicago.

A smattering of pictures have rolled in, and I'll keep posting when they do.

**The Site**
I know one day I'll stop being amazed at your generosity and appreciation, but that's not today.  <del datetime="2009-03-01T14:50:21+00:00">**$211**</del> **$239** was donated and <del datetime="2009-03-01T14:50:21+00:00">**$60**</del> **$61** in ads gave February <del datetime="2009-03-01T14:50:21+00:00">**$271**</del> **$300** as a total.  January was, as an example, $22, which gives you guys a clear indicator as to the difference a month can bring.  Actually, the different 10 days can bring.  $45  from February came after the 19th (when I asked for your help).  So for 2009, JFO has $293 (rounding up) which is more than enough to renew the domain for 20 years.

I had to sit back and blink a lot at that.

Right now, if you haven't donated, you don't have to. Click on the ads. Seriously, it's a bizarre mathematical ratio, based on visitors vs clicks depending on ads, but it works. If you see offensive ads, let me know and I'll kill them ASAP.  I try to get the ones for 'health products' out of here, but I know the stray Viagra ad pops up once in a while.  Pun intended.

**Community**
The GSR communities are still the noisiest (they know I love 'em!) and <a href="http://www.yourtaxdollarsatwork.org/forums/">Your Tax Dollars at Work</a> is having a con in Chicago. I have every intention of showing up, seeing as I live in Chicago, so I hope to meet some of you there.

I'm sure I'm missing some things, and hopefully I'll get better at these!

_Updated at 8:52 for the extra dollar reported by Google and the extra $30 (before 'taxes') donated! **$300**, people! I'm in awe!_
