She was in Rome recently, but did you know she also went up to BC?  That's British Columbia, for those of you who aren't as familiar with the area.  While up there, Jorja caught a spot of <a href="http://www.seashorecharters.com/whalewatching.php">whale watching</a>.

No photos of the event, but apparently whales are big Jorja fans!  I knew I liked them for a reason.  I have no idea if she saw humpback or orca, but having been whale watching before, I highly recommend it. They're beautiful creatures!
