## Synopsis

Two high school students go missing after the big game: basketball hero and photography lover, Ryan, and his cheerleader girlfriend, Megan.

Ryan turns out to have been a sexual fiend, sleeping with much of the school's female population, as well as his photography teacher, Diane. Because of that, Charlie and Sheila, Megan's friends, had decided to pull a prank on Ryan by tying him up and making him admit he had crabs and was a sexual pervert. Ryan broke free and fought then, hitting Sheila in the head (which eventually killed her), before Megan accidentally cut Ryan's jugular, killing him, and they left Ryan in his van.

Diane was obsessed with Ryan, photographing him to excess in life, but also in death. After Sheila and Charlie left, Diane hit Megan with her car, leaving her for dead, and took Ryan's body. Diane killed herself, after setting up her camera to photograph them together in death. Megan is left paralyzed, and unable to remember the events of that night -- though Nick wonders if her amnesia is selective.

## Review

Sara works Ryan's car, and when Warrick finds multiple pairs of panties, Sara observes that one night in college, her boyfriend offered her a pair of panties that weren't hers. As they'd claimed to be monogamous, Sara's boyfriend said the panties were his sister's. Warrick says he hopes her taste in men have improved, and Sara's reply is a slight smile.

At the end of the episode, Grissom has his beard shaved off by Sara.

## Notes

* Sara dated a boy in college, in a relationship she thought was monogamous.
* Sara knows how to shave someone using a straight razor.

**Warrick:** Oof. How'd he explain that one?
**Sara:** He said they belonged to his sister.
**Warrick:** Yeah right.
**Sara:** I know.
