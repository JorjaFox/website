While we know that CSI:NY and CSI: Miami will be around for another season, we're at 'pretty sure' for the mothership right now.

<blockquote>Despite yet another successful season, including current dominance in total viewers and adults 18-49, the ongoing concern at CBS is the glut of procedural crime solvers, including the CSI franchise.
 
“As long as those shows continue to be competitive, as long as the fans still continue to watch the shows, they’re going to stay on the air,” said Tassler regarding the futures of CSI: Miami and CSI: NY. “Both shows are doing incredibly well in their new time periods, given what was there before.”
 
Parent series CSI, which was expected to flip time periods with The Mentalist this season, is remaining intact and likely to return in 2011-12. </blockquote>

What does this mean for Jorja?  Well, her contract remains in flux, as ever.  I'm starting to think she's happy this way. Tormenting us.
