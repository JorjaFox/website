## Synopsis

The CSI teams come together to save one of their own when they learn one team member has been kidnapped and buried alive, and now they must find him before he suffocates under 5 feet of dirt.

## Review

When Grissom determines that the insects on Nick are fire ants, and that they're only found in certain areas, Sara remembers that the suspect's daughter worked in a nursery and pin-points which one, allowing them to find Nick.
