Jorja Fox probably prefers not to describe her talents as "acting chops." The dedicated vegetarian told The Sun's Claire Bickley she even finds playing one of CSI's forensic investigators a little too realistic.

**THE SUN:** Does the show's grisly subject matter ever make you sick?

**FOX:** I think I've toughened up. My skin is a little bit tougher than when I started. That was my only concern when I started the show. Was I going to be able to stomach this?

**THE SUN:** What have you had to stomach?

**FOX:** All I'll say is there were probably 1,000 bugs involved very intimately with a stuntwoman. It completely caught me off guard. My stomach turned upside down when I saw her. I thought, 'Oh yeah, I work on CSI.'

**THE SUN:** Was squeamishness also an issue in your previous role as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER?

**FOX:** At one point there was a scene on ER where I was supposed to be practising suturing. A lot of doctors will use pigskin and pigs' feet because pigskin is very close to human skin. Neil Baer, who is a producer on the show, made it an eggplant for me. So that was very nice of him.

**THE SUN:** Did ER make you a vegetarian?

**FOX:** No. In fact, when I told Neil I was a vegetarian, he made my character a vegetarian.
