<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3737" title="Crowdrise Logo" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/09/crowdrise-logo.jpg" alt="Crowdrise Logo" width="93" height="93" />The next time someone asks you about what good a fan community is, tell them <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-bday2011/">"Actually, we raised over 100% of our target to help clean the ocean and keep water safe to drink."</a>

You see, we, the JFO Nation, hit the 100% mark in August, for our Summer 2011 fundraiser.  And then we kept going.

Every year, for ... a year now, I've done a CrowdRise fundraiser, because it puts the money in a public place that you can see, and makes sure the right people gets the money, _and_ they take less overhead than PayPal.  So thank you for making the third CrowdRise fundraiser a success.

PS: If you missed out and are still feeling the need to do more, I suggest donating to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timgorski/how-i-became-an-elephant">"How I Became an Elephant" Kickstarter project</a>.
