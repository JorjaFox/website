Raising money to clean 2/3rds of the planet (i.e. water), the Blue Note Karaoke Experience allows audience members to get up on stage and perform their favorite songs with the backing of a live band.  

Jorja attended last year, but there's no word on if she's going this year.

The doors open at 8pm at OC Tavern (2369 South El Camino Real, San Clemente, CA).  Admission is $10 at the door, or hit up Ticketmaster.
