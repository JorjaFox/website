**_What A Pair!_** is a non-profit 501c3 that was created when a personal tragedy  motivated three Hollywood producers  to do something to give back. Co-founders **Jo Levi DiSante**, **Jody Price**, and **Ruth Stalford** believe that by partnering the right people with the right organizations, allowing folks to share their talent and expertise, we can make the world a better place and enrich lives.

Since 2002, they have worked with some of the best-known female talent to successfully stage eight Broadway-caliber productions of celebrity duets. They have raised over $3 million dollars to support basic and clinical breast cancer research.
