<blockquote><strong>Will we get an update on how Sara and Grissom are doing when Jorja Fox returns to <em>CSI</em>? — Michael</strong>
<strong>ADAM: </strong>What kind of an update are you looking for, Jennifer? A big one? OK, then: Sara and Gil got hitched! Unfortunately, it sounds like married life doesn't suit Sara. "I think she's struggling a little bit with being a housewife," Marg Helgenberger says, explaining why Mrs. Grissom returns to the team. "She comes [to help us] from Paris, where her husband is giving some kind of a lecture series." Come on, Gil — PowerPoints bore everyone, especially wives.
