First of all, that you everyone for being so nice to Jorja on Twitter! I'm sure she appreciates your kind words.

This is not about that, however, but about the fake twitter accounts that have cropped up again. Please do not engage with them. It just encourages them to play pretend, and makes things harder for everyone.

The following accounts are fake: Ted Danson (@Danson_Ted), George Eads (@GeorgeEadsTV_), Robert David Hall (@RobertDavidHal), Laurence Fishburne (@Laurence_Fishbu), Marc Vann (@Marc_Vann - who has recently copped to being a fan account), Louis Vartann (@LouisVartann and FFS, that's a character!), "@CSI_Television", @CBS_Show, @CsiSeason.

They are all, fakes, guys, don't get sucked in. There are many giveaways, but here are some clues: these accounts _all_ talk to each other right away; they are always 'confirmed' by each other; their grammar and spelling is not native to English speakers. Sometimes they fake pictures:

<del>I mean, really, who couldn't tell that was Photoshopped?</del> The real Gary is <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryDourdan">@GaryDourdan</a> and yes, that's him.

_[Edited: The account was deleted after I posted this!]_

I don't pretend to understand why people do this, but they do. So please, block them and ignore them. Whatever you do, don't reply to them, bully them, or harass them. It just seems to encourage them, so clearly the only answer is to make this sick game not fun at all to them, by not playing along.

If you're someone who makes those accounts and you're reading this, please stop. Change your profile to say you're a _fan_ account and not 'official.' The word 'official' means that you are the person or company, and you clearly are not. We can tell. All you're doing is making the world a less pleasant place.
