## Synopsis

Grissom's nemesis, serial killer Paul Millander, reappears and claims a third victim. The latest slaying matches Millander's previous killings in that it recreates his father's murder, which Millander witnessed as a boy. In each case, the victim is shot once through the chest while lying in a bathtub. A nearby tape recorder contains the person's supposed suicide message.

All three victims share the same birthday of Aug. 17--the date Millander's father was slain--with the years in descending order from 1959. So presumably, the killer's next target was born Aug. 17, 1956...which just happens to be Grissom's birthday.

Grissom realizes that Millander could be after him next. Tracing speeding tickets issued to Millander's victims, the team learns that all of them were issued tickets through the same court. To their surprise, Grissom and Catherine discover Paul Millander, serving as a judge under the name Douglas Mason. In an effort to prove he is not Paul Millander, Mason invites Grissom to dinner where he claims his fingerprints will prove his innocence.

Grissom and Catherine also track down Isabelle Millander and discover a hand print belonging to Paul Millander's deceased father. They then begin to suspect that Paul could be using his father's prints to cover his tracks.

## Review
