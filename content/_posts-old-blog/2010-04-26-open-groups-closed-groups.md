BuddyPress defines them as "Powerful public, private or hidden groups allow your users to break the discussion down into specific topics."  Which I hope is enough to get your heads around the idea that a group on this site is like a 'subtopic' of JFO.

And the question of the day is: Should I be in charge of defining all groups, or should you guys have free rein?

BuddyPress groups are one of those really powerful, really annoying things that I love and hate.  On the one hand, I can make a run of defined groups that everyone can join and post in (like we did with the forums). On the other hand, I can let you all make whatever groups you want, and YOU guys would moderate them as you wanted. Within reason of course. I retain the right to delete offensive groups, or ones that are anti-Jorja, but I would allow you to make, say, a "David Caruso Fangirls Group" if you really wanted one.  Does that make sense?

Anyway, I'm trying to get a feel for what YOU guys want out of things.  Right now, groups are only made by me.  If you want one, you have to ask for it.  Do you think it's reasonable to open this up? Comments are closed on this post, and it's just a straight vote for yes, no and maybe.  Once there's some sort of a general consensus, I'll start puttering about.
