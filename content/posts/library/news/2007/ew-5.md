As fans continue to fret about whether Jorja Fox will walk away from her six-figure gig on "CSI", an insider tells EW.com that the Oct. 18 episode will feature a very unorthodox marriage proposal by Gil to Fox's character, Sara. So far, very little has been revealed about the duo's clandestine relationship, though fans first got an idea that something was up in the season finale two years ago, and over last season, when Sara was seen sitting up in bed with Gil (William Peterson) in one episode. Next week's proposal will surely spawn speculation that Fox may stay on the show despite published reports stating otherwise. Fox, along with CBS, have yet to officially confirm or deny her departure. Meanwhile, fans have launched a Save Jorja campaign by sending cash, balloon, and Life Savers candy to "CSI"'s production offices. A show spokeswoman declined comment.
