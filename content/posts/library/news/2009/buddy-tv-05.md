**Item two: It won't be that much of a reunion.** The biggest item on the "CSI" front is the return of Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle; it's been confirmed that she'll be appearing in the tenth season premiere, and in yet-to-be-disclosed extra episodes. Obvious question is, is Grissom returning? William Petersen is, sadly, not returning to the role. At least not yet.

But executive producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed that some classic characters will be returning to the series. "The last time we saw [serial killer] Paul Millander was in season 2 when Grissom had dinner at [his alter ego] Judge Mason's house, because, if you remember Paul lived a double life as a judge," she said. "And we met Mrs. Mason and their young son, Craig. Well, Paul's dead, but Mrs. Mason and Craig live on. And we will see them in episode 2."

And that, I think, is where Sara's return comes in. Remember when they hinted that Sara will be compelled to return to Las Vegas for some reason, right? Executive producer Naren Shankar spills the crucial bit: it's another serial killer on the loose. "Starting at the end of our premiere, a brand new nemesis [will emerge] who has a very unique way of killing," he said. "This time, the crime scene is always the body. We're calling him Dr. Jekyl."

He also revealed that viewers will finally get an idea about the ring Langston's (Laurence Fishburne) got on his finger. Which makes me wonder: Langston's going to be tested like this, so this season must be his big coming-in-circle thingie. And, being a fan-probably one of the few fans-of Langston, I can't help but be excited.
