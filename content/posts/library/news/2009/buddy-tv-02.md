I think we all saw this coming, right? The return of Sara Sidle (uhh, Grissom) cannot be just for five episodes this season. Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox's return to the current season of "CSI" will be indefinite, which means we'll see more of her than we initially thought this season.

"This season is about bringing the family back together again," executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told *Entertainment Weekly*'s Michael Ausiello. "Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team."

"From our point of view, the more [episodes], the better," she added. "As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for."

But the extension of Fox's stay doesn't necessarily mean a return to CSI for William Petersen, who played her former supervisor (and current husband) Gil Grissom. Future episodes will address the unusual living arrangement between the two: Grissom teaching in Paris, and Sara solving crimes in Las Vegas.

"We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas," Mendelsohn said. "Everyone on the team is a little interested. They're like, 'What's the deal? Grissom's there, you're here, how does that work?' They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship. They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us."
