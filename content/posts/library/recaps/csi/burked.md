## Synopsis

Grissom and crew are called in after high roller Tony Braun, a known drug addict and the son of a Las Vegas Mogul, is found dead in his house by a gardener. Since drug paraphernalia is discovered near his body and it is also determined that he had recently inhaled heroin, the cause of death is at first thought to be an overdose. But further examination of the corpse reveals that Braun had been restrained at some point with duct tape, leading Grissom to believe that the victim was forced to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and, perhaps, other drugs.

## Review

Sara hands off 20 rolls of film to be processed, then finds an earring backing on the rug. She later finds balled up duct tape in the kitchen trash, and with an idea she got from a TV commercial, recovers a print from the tape by putting it in the freezer.

## Notes

* Sara is inventive, unafraid to try methods that aren't exactly in the book.
* Sara is supportive of Grissom when he gets a bit down.
* Sara uses a baseball metaphor when talking to Warrick -- her first reference to sports.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Oops! Watch it! Evidence.
**Grissom:** Where'd you get it?
**Sara:** Cracker box. It was all stuck together, muckity-muck. I don't want to ruin any potential prints, but I saw this TV dinner commercial and it hit me. I'm going to put it in the freezer!

**Sara:** Listen to you. Would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?
