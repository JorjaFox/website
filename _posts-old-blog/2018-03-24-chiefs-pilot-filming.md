By all reports (thank you <a href="http://season-zero.com">Season Zero</a>), _Chiefs_ starts filming their pilot on Sunday in Atlanta.

Let's take the time to wish Jorja, Carol, Liz, and everyone working on the show the best of luck. Remember, the last pilot Jorja filmed that didn't get picked up died a horrible, ugly death (_The True Story)_. So clearly she's good luck for shows.

Got that, CBS?

In other _Chiefs_ related news, this appears to be a cop drama and **not** a procedural, which is a change from how CBS has been picking shows. This is a good thing.

Jorja's character is a married Texan with a child in the current write-up, but that may change since they're apparently retooling things for her. Keep your fingers crossed.
