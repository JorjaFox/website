## Summary

Carol finds herself at a career crossroads when her MCAT results come back. She's torn between nursing and becoming a doctor, with Kerry grooming her for medicine, while Carol tries to care for a mother with a dying child. Carter debates whether to report Edson for falsifying a patient's chart. Benton takes a personal day to care for Carla. Dr. Greene treats a couple concocting odd situations to see how quickly the staff finds a solution. Jerry, Wendy and Jeanie search for a genetically engineered mouse.

## Review

Doyle comes by to see Carter, who's in the surgeon's doghouse (aka a lab). Doyle hangs out with Carter, messing around with graspers to practice laparoscopic surgery, and later assists him on a GSW. When Carter catches fellow surgical intern Dale Edson falsifying a chart, he tells Doyle but doesn't call Edson out on it. Doyle gives Carter grief about this decision, but comforts him with a beer anyway.

## Notes

* Maggie hides Heineken beer in the fridge in the doctors' lounge.
