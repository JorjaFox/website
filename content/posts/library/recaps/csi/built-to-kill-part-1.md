## Synopsis

Robert O'Brien commits suicide at a Sam Braun's  party, with alprazolam in his system. Robert's life-partner has the bottle of pills, and the gun used is registered in his name, making him a suspect. Sesame seeds in the gun, Robert's mouth, Robert's pockets, and an oven mitt with trace GSR prove that it really was a suicide.

A performer at Cirque du Soleil's KA finds a dead body just off backstage. Celia Noel was accidently killed when sneaking backstage to see behind the scenes, and she was struck in the head by a prop.

Brass receives a medal of valor for being shot in "Way to Go". Unhappy about the public reminder of his stupidity, Brass hides it away and goes to get a tattoo of the date he was shot, just below the scar from the bullet. After dancing at a bar with Nick, Catherine is drugged and wakes up naked in a hotel room.

Grissom finds an exact miniature replica of the crime scene he's investigating, while at the crime scene.

## Review

Sara works the O'Brien case, and inquires as to how David is doing with his in laws. Sara teases Grissom in his office later, quoting him for effect. The two are quite obviously still in a relationship. While Sara's working with Warrick over lunch, Grissom brings her food: a veggie burger.

## Notes

* Sara is still a vegetarian.
* Sara and Grissom are still dating.
* Sara seems okay with the fact that the suicide and his partner were a couple.

## Quotes

**Sara:** It's hard to swallow when you have a gun in your mouth.

**Sara:** _(to Grissom)_ According to my supervisor, we're not really in the business of why.
