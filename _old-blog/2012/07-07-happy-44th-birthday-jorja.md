<a href="https://jorjafox.net/?attachment_id=4881" rel="attachment wp-att-4881"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4881" title="jellyfish" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/07/jellyfish-210x140.jpeg" alt="" width="100" height="75" /></a>Today is Jorja's birthday, and every year I run a fundraiser for her birthday. The goal is usually pretty simple, somewhere around $500 for a charity of her choice, and donations open up around the season finale of CSI and carry to her birthday. Usually we make it. We did this year.

Jorja is 44 wonderful years old, and this year we raised $510 for <a href="http://www.healthebay.org/">Heal The Bay</a>, who works hard to keep the oceans clean. I told them about the fundraiser on Facebook and they were delighted. So am I.

Donations actually close end of today, so if you want to scurry over and donate, I don't think the ocean will mind. Donations are handled through Crowdrise (so you don't have to just trust I don't keep the money) at the <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-bday2012/">Jorja's Birthday - 2012</a> page.
