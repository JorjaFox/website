For once, I kind of agree with their recap. The first part is all about how the season stared (Ecklie in the ER, the grandkid missing), and then we smash into "Code Blue Plate Special" and "Forget Me Not" before jumping to the finale. So ... basically Sara's one third of the recap! I feel all special and shiny now.
