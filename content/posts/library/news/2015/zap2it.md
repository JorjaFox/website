After 15 years, 335 episodes and countless grisly death scenes, 'CSI' said goodbye with a TV movie entitled 'Immortality.' It was a chance to bid adieu to old friends, wrap up some loose ends, and watch a television institution ride off into the sunset.

But in true 'Crime Scene Investigation' fashion, it was also an opportunity to bring some grisly drama. With Las Vegas itself under attack, would the return of Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass help save the day? What does the future hold for D.B. and Sara? And what about the return of Lady Heather? Read on for all the answers but beware: Spoilers ahead.

The episode was largely dominated by Grissom, which seems only right since the character was the driving force of the show for nine seasons. 'Looks like somebody jumped a shark,' Grissom joked at one point, very tongue-in-cheek. Ted Danson had a handful of scenes, and Elizabeth Shue was killed off rather unceremoniously. Professional dominatrix and fan favorite Lady Heather also had a memorable return, as she was at the center of multiple twists and turns that had viewers buzzing on social media -- even if Jorja Fox's Sara Sidle wasn't in the mood.

Grissom had a lot of great lines, including a poem: 'Evidence may bear, even if rare,' he said. 'It's what's not there that gives you a scare.' But ultimately a lot of it came down to terrorism, Catherine's box and a lonely 52-Hertz whale. And although some may not love Gil's happy ending that had him and Sara boating off together (many consider their romance as the moment when 'CSI' jumped its own shark), it was a beautiful farewell to a beloved character.

With 'CSI' gone for good, fans will undoubtedly be sad that they're losing a landmark show that some feared had hung on too long. Then again, as Gil said in one of his final moments: 'You can't lose something you never had.'
