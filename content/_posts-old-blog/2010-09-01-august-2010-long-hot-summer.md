I mentioned on Twitter that ad revenue is at an all time low. Normally I get about $15 from Google.  Even if I include the proceeds from Ad Free, August only netted about $6.  Thankfully!  Someone made a nice donation to cover the difference, but please do remember to click on any ads you like. It helps me and costs you nothing.

The gnus in review!

<h2>Breaking news</h2>
Guys! Guys!

We raised <strong><em>$1000</em></strong> to help clean up the Gulf!  The money has been donated to Surfrider.org

I sent Jorja's peeps a message this morning. She already knew we were doing this, but since at the beginning of the month we were at about $650, I don't think anyone expected this result!  Jorja said 'Huge thanks!' and I repeat that to everyone who donated, tweeted, facebooked, told a friend, or even just thought about this.  HUGE thanks! You guys amaze the hell out of me!

<h2>Jorja Stuff</h2>

<strong>Advocacy</strong>
<a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/prop-8-on-trial-day-of-decision/">Prop 8, which Jorja was against, has been deemed unconstitutional.</a>  Then I reminded you that <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/animal-acres-updates-goats-and-gala/">Animal Acres's Gala is coming up soon, but they need help with their goats, due to fires.</a> Being the activist she is, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-asks-swedens-pm-to-ban-fur-farms/">Jorja asked the Prime Minister of Sweden to ban fur farms.</a>  In return, she'll be <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-to-be-honor-at-9-0-2-10-celebration-event/">given an award at the HSUS 9.02.10 celebration in Beverley Hills</a> (which rather quickly <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/90210-celebration-sold-out/">sold out</a>).  She also donated art for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorjas-art-for-sale-to-benefit-the-wcc/">The Wolf Conservation Center (WCC)</a>, which will be on display in September.

<strong>CSI</strong>
The first <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/season-11-vegas-candids/">season 11 CSI candids from Vegas</a> showed up and Jorja's <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-season-11-cast-status/">cast status</a> was explained as much as it ever is.  GSR was listed at Helium as one of the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/heliums-top-10-gsr/">top ten TV couples</a> and we finally got a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-season-11-promo-video/">season 11 promo video</a>, but not with a lot of Sara.  The French magazine Télé Star reported that we would only get <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/tele-star-reports-jorja-to-appear-in-11-episodes/">eleven episodes with Sara</a>.

Finally we got some a press release for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/press-release-csi-11x01-shock-waves/">Ep 11x01: Shock Waves</a> and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/press-release-pool-shark/">Ep 11x02: Pool Shark</a>, as well as a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-season-10-ultimate-look-back/">look back at season 10</a>.  It's starting to look like we may get Jorja for the first 11 episodes in a row.  I'd be more excited if I wanted to watch the Squeegel episode, but I'll live.  Speaking of, recaps and screencaps for those first two episodes will be a few days late. Real life being what it is, I won't be able to even watch the eps till the Sunday after they air! If you want to write up a recap and email it in to webmaster@jorjafox.net that would be very appreciated!

I snuck in some episode stills too, when you were blinking.
