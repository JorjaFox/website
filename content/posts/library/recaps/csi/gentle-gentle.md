## Synopsis

Grissom finds it difficult to control his emotions when he investigates the alleged kidnapping of the infant son of a Dot-Com Las Vegas millionaire family, especially when the evidence begins pointing to various family members who may be involved in the disappearance.

## Review

Sara arrives at the scene, and Grissom has her run the ransom note over to QD (Questionable Documents). Sara goes to QD and they determine the printers from the house don't match the note. Sara calls Grissom with the news, and he has her check the printers from the husband's office.

Sara confronts Grissom about his emotional outburst in DNA, quoting back what he told her several weeks ago during a case (don't let your personal feelings get in the way of a case); Grissom throws it back at her in an instance of 'do as I say, not as I do'.

Sara and several officers bring in the printers from the husband's office -- over 200 of them. Sara tells Grissom that the note came from the husband's secretary's printer. Sara tells Grissom that the baby was smothered with something flame retardant, but not infant clothes -- she goes with him back to the scene, where he finds an oven mitt.

## Notes

* Sara is not afraid to confront Grissom about his emotional outburst, repeating what he told her.

## Quotes

**Sara:** _(As Grissom runs off to investigate)_ Hey, can I come with you?

- - -

**Sara:** Grissom?\
**Grissom:** _(angrily)_ What?\
**Sara:** _(speaking softly)_ You told me a few weeks ago that nothing is personal. No victim should be special. _(pauses)_ Everyone follows your lead.\
**Grissom:** Everyone didn't find that baby. I did. And that little boy is dead because someone lost their temper or screwed up, or god knows what. So, excuse me, but this victim is special.
