It was a star-studded opening night for the burlesque musical _Minsky's_ at the Ahmanson Theatre in LA.  Jorja Fox enjoyed the show and in the video, can be seen and heard at the 44 second mark.

> One of the great things that I love about the show is that no matter what's going on at the end of the day, people kind of just want a place where they can be happy for a minute.  And where they can lose themselves for a minute.  And there was a line in the play specifically that said 'Where they don't have any shame for a minute.' You know, no matter what's happening?  And that's ... it was really beautiful.
