The most popular _topic_ of 2010 was, kind of expected, "The Two Mrs. Grissoms."  If I added up the views and comments for those posts alone, it would eclipse all the others made in 2010!  I really hope the CSI heads are paying attention, because a lot of weight is resting on that episode.

Late breaking news that everyone liked to hear.  Jorja's sticking around for more than 11 episodes this season. Yay!

This was, perhaps, my favorite post to make for 2010.  I adore Marlee Matlin.  When we heard about this episode, Mrs. Ipstenu and I speculated that Marlee would rock for the role of Grissom's ex, and then realized we'd never know who to root for!  We'll have to sort this out by Feburary!

Yeah, this being a hit didn't surprise anyone, did it?  Didn't think so.  It was an adorable picture! They hadn't seen each other since their _West Wing_ days, according to Marlee.

**2. **<a href="/blog/2010/csi-11x10-418-427/">CSI Ep 11x10: 418/427</a>
I probably have to chalk this up to the fact that Jorja had those two damned awesome scenes dealing with the son.  This was the sneak attack episode, for me.  I watched it going 'Eh.' up until that very last moment, where you barely see Jorja, but she manages to rip your guts out just with a hand-hold.  That's acting, man!

Most of you were _really_ excited to read about "The Two Mrs. Grissoms".  Really, what else can I say about this?  I'm really hoping the hype is worth it!

So what was your favorite post of 2010?
