Following an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to "CSI" later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama's executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will "reappear" in a September 24th episode where viewers will "discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas."

The announcement comes in the wake of a 5 year battle between Fox and CBS, and just two months after reports that Laurence Fishburne (who replaced series star William Petersen last year) has been unable to connect with loyal viewers. In 2004, 41 year-old Fox was fired from "CSI" over a contract dispute, only to be rehired a short time later. In 2007, following rumors she was once again being considered for dismissal, an online forum called "Your Tax Dollars At Work" began a "Save Sara Sidle" campaign, in which around $15,000 viewers sent the show's producers $1 each to keep Fox on the show. Fox later told "EW" she would be leaving the show to get a break "from the commitment of a weekly television series."

Jorja will be making her "CSI" return on September 24th during the show's season 10 premiere.
