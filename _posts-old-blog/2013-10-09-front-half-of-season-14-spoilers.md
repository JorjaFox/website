Now that we're looking at some solid info, the front half of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation_(season_14)">Season Fourteen</a> is looking pretty good.

Jorja will _not_ be in episodes 4 and 9 ("Last Supper" and "Check in and Check Out") however in so far as good episodes for Jorja go, you should tune in to the following:
<ul>
	<li>"Frame by Frame" (episode 300), which has an homage to Grissom and is expected to have good Sara scenes</li>
	<li>"Girls Gone Crazy", which purports to be heavy on all three female CSIs (about time!)</li>
</ul>
From <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/10/csi-stages-appendicitement-sequel/">CSI Files</a>:
<blockquote>CSI Files has learned exclusively that this season’s tenth episode, “Girls Gone Wild” will find the spotlight on the women of _CSI_: Morgan Brody (**Elisabeth Harnois**), Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**) and Julie Finlay (**Elisabeth Shue**). In the flashback heavy episode we find the three CSIs prepare for a Reno getaway where Morgan has been given a gift certificate for a spa treatment. After inviting her two female counterparts along for the weekend, Finn’s car breaks down, leaving them stuck in Vernon for the night. When Finlay meets up with a man at a bar after some karaoke time with her friends, we discover that the man is now dead, and Finlay accused of killing him.

Detective Crawford (**Alimi Ballard**) joins Captain Brass (**Paul Guilfoyle**) in the investigation. “Girls Gone Wild” was written by **Melissa Byer** and **Treena Hancock**, and will be directed by **Alec Smight**.</blockquote>
Soon we'll get some info about the back half, but some other tidbits. I believe Jorja will miss episode 9 (which is filming now) because she was in Hawaii (for the Lion Ark film presentation). George Eads is due back on set for that episode, which also has Jordin Sparks (from American Idol).

Me? I can't wait for "Girls Gone Crazy"!
