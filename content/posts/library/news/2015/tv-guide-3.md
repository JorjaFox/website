Zuiker is staying pretty mum on the details of the finale, other than acknowledging that there is an explosion that "paralyzes Las Vegas" and hinting that the episode will deal with the resolution of Grissom's relationships with both Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) and fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). In some ways, that feels ironic because of the show's insistence early on, partially at Petersen's behest, not to go home with its characters. But Zuiker says the TV landscape has changed, as has the audience's desire for character.

"Our quote back in the day was, 'We do character in dropperfuls,'" Zuiker says with a laugh. "The funny joke of it all is the one thing that wasn't scripted that really turned our series upside down was when Sara Sidle wiped a piece of chalk from drywall off Gil Grissom's face. The second she did that, it was the start of something that got people really interested. We will certainly explore the relationship between Grissom and Sara that started with that conversation and quite possibly build an entire finale around that."
