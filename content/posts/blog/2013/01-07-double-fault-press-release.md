Guest stars include 18-time Grand Slam Champion Chris Evert, three-time Grand Slam Champion Lindsay Davenport, announcer and former tennis pro Justin Gimelstob as themselves and model Catrinel Menghia Marlon as Italian bombshell Elisabetta.</blockquote>
Interesting. We know Jorja plays tennis, but given how short Chris Evret looks, I think that was a good choice. I also don't know if Jorja's in this episode, but she is in "Dead Air" so there's that.
