**1 EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW!**

Jorja's Coming Back to "CSI"

When Jorja Fox left "CSI" last fall, producers promised it wouldn't be the last fans would see of her. They'll hold up their end of the bargain when the actress' Sara returns to the crime drama for it's third episode next season. "It involves an old friend of Sara's who has to confront a [life or] death situation with his wife," she teases. Fox, who shot the episode the last week of May, talks to TV GUIDE about her decision to leave &#8212; and return.

&#8212;-

**<font color=#660033>Did you think it was really the end when you left?</font>** Let's just say the door was left open. The kindest thing that the writers did for Sara Sidle was to walk her out in one piece. I had an amazing, beautiful, honorable, dignified exit.

**<font color=#660033>How did your exit story evolve?</font>** It was decided she was just split from Grissom. As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous. In areas of communicating their hearts, it's never been a specialty for either of them. So perhaps if she talked to him, he would have been able to convince her to stay. An executive producer asked me, "What would Sara say in a letter?" And I responded, "I'll write something down and send it to you." I never expected in a million years that it would become the letter.

**<font color=#660033>What do you miss the most about being on the show?</font>** I miss the people. When I left in October, it was so decisive &#8212; everybody got me a good-bye cake. It's a surprise for me to be back, especially this soon.

**<font color=#660033>Have you done anything liberating since you left?<</font>** I cut my hair &#8212; a couple inches only but it was a huge deal. I kept the same hairstyle for Sara all that time. The character is very consistent, very steady, kind of stubborn and stuck. Little things like that have been fun.

**<font color=#660033>What have you done professionally?</font>** Mostly not-for-profit stuff. I produced a play in L.A. called "Stay Forever." We raised a bunch of money for homeless gay kids. It's a bio piece about Dusty Springfield. We're hoping to present it in New York in the gall.

**<font color=#660033>Did you keep watching "CSI"?</font>** Yes. I TiVo'd id. When I heard I was returning, there were certain parts of last season that I felt Sara would be aware of. I watched as much as I could.

**<font color=#660033>Are you ready to do more TV?</font>** It will be so hard to follow up "CSI". No matter what I do, it's big shoes to fill. If I'm going to do TV, then my loyalty and my heart belong to "CSI".
