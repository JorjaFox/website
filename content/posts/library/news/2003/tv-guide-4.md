**Question:** Okay, what is up with CSI? In the beginning it was no romance,
strictly science. Well now, all the hype is that Gil and Sara are going to
fall in love, or whatever they're saying. I mean, what about the finale?
Why didn't they have Gil tell Sara about his surgery, if the master plan is
to have them together? Why would he tell Catherine if really he wants to be
with Sara? It makes no sense, and they are just blowing the finale off like
it never happened. Everyone makes a big deal that Sara wiped chalk off
Gil's cheek, yet Catherine hugs him, and not a word is said. I am just so
confused. Can you maybe clarify what exactly the writers are trying to
accomplish? ? Janine

**Matt:** From what little I know of the situation, the producers will admit to
a sexual tension between Gil and Sara, and maybe even between Gil and
Catherine. But if this is why you're tuning in CSI, I think you're destined
to be disappointed no matter who you want Gil to lean on, hug, kiss,
whatever. (My mail favors Gil and Catherine, no question about it. Very
little support for Gil and Sara.) But I'm all for CSI being all science, no
romance. A laboratory liaison on this show would be as disastrous a mistake
as showing Jack McCoy actually hitting on any of his lovely ADAs on Law &
Order. I can understand why the writers would add little hints of
on-the-job attraction in an otherwise just-the-facts show just to shake
things up a little, but in this case it has become a real distraction for
CSI fans. Which makes me think it's dangerous territory they're all better
off just avoiding. I tune in for the weird cases, the fascinating gadgets,
and the pleasure of watching some good actors play detective. If I want a
soap opera, I've got plenty of other places to go.
