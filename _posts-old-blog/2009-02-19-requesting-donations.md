The short version is: Please click on our ads more, or if you have ideas about revenue, let me know. Also, if you are financially comfortable, donations are very much appreciated.

I know, it's been a long time since I've had to make a post like this! So long that it looks like it was 2005.  JFO has been, rather comfortably, living off of Google Ads for the last 20 months.  We were averaging $.75 a day, which, as the site only cost us $20 a month, kept us above board.  Now, as the news for Jorja trickles in less and less, as expected, the ad revenue has dropped to $.50 a day which is going to make it hard to upgrade the server (shouldn't need to, I've fixed the slowness issues) or renew the domain (which we must do by July). 

I can, and I will, continue to pay this all out of pocket for the month to month cost. But the domain renewal will be rough and I am asking you for a bit of help there. Since I don't keep the 'surplus' from year to year, and instead donate it to charity, there's usually nothing in the kitty come January. Today we have $50, and $30 is from a donation. 

I'm not asking for help with the $250 site costs. I'm asking, hoping, that you can help out with the domain.  Basically, however much I can raise via donations or above and beyond with ads, I will put to the domain.  The domain will cost between $35 (1 year) and $280 (20 years). Or $1000 for '100 years' if Bill Gates is reading this.  If no one donates, well, I know I have enough saved in my emergency JFO fund to pay for 3 years of domain. But that would tap me out in case something did happen.

The economy sucks everywhere, and we don't all have a lot of money.  Right now, I can afford the costs. But now that JFO isn't making a 'profit', I'm dipping into the funds for Domain Name renewal, which is coming up relatively soon.  I've messed with ad formats and layouts, trying to find a setup that encourages more click-throughs.  RSS feeds and emails now have ads, which while not a reliable source of income, are helping out.

So. IF, and only if, you are financially secure, donations would be nice (currently accepting <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=KEEciTDTffjGUeA8mGZpBo--d8_v4MM3yvmgkEpy1CBJLJIInqimny-r8PK&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f9fecf49521b3f5afc18ba9034b1c79cbd5929eac28412d99">PayPal Donations</a> - click on the icon on the side bar). If it would cause you hardship, or you just feel squidgy about giving money to the internet mysterious people, please keep your money and click on our ads. But if you want to give JFO the $4.50 instead of Starbucks, I would be very appreciative. If, like my better half, the economic downturn has shuttered your employer and you're finding it hard to get gainful work, click on the ads.

And of course, if you have an idea on how we could make money, legally, please let me know.

Thank you.
