Twenty years ago, <em>ER</em> debuted on NBC. Which means 18 years ago this winter we had the first single page version of this site. Sorry, I think I'm feeling incredibly old... if this website was a person it would be going to college, which is where it started!

Okay, now that I can breathe again, The Wire has looked at <a href="http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/09/fifteen-years-at-county-general-definitively-ranking-all-of-ers-doctors-and-nurses/380164/">Fifteen Years at County General: Definitively Ranking the Cast of 'ER'</a>

<em>(Recurring Seasons 3-5)</em> ER should have paid to keep Fox around (she departed for The <em>West Wing</em> and then <em>CSI</em>). Appearing before Weaver came out, she was the show's first major gay character (although her orientation was much more obliquely referenced) and just the kind of admirable no-nonsense physician had plenty of in the early seasons. Later years demanded everyone have some kind of crippling personal drama, but Doyle mostly just did her job well.</blockquote>
That makes me totally miss Doyle now, wow. She was great. I still wish we'd gotten that final send off with Doyle vs Romano. In my dreams, the helicopter that killed him was named Doyle...
