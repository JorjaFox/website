<strong>cluesby4</strong> had the idea of flowers, <strong>sidlechick87</strong> knew what to do with it, and <strong>Ipstenu</strong> suggested a plant. End result? The JAA/JFO fundraiser is on hold to get a plant for Jorja to thank her for returning to CSI. Want to donate?  I'm just going to let sidlechick87 tell it like it is!

<blockquote>Alright, about a day ago <a href='http://cluesby4.livejournal.com/'><b>cluesby4</b></a> put up a post about getting Jorja something to show how much we appreciate her coming back to CSI for the time she'll be on there. As you know (or should know by now... unless you live under a rock), Jorja will be back on CSI for a short few episode run.<br /><br />I personally liked her idea of the yellow roses. Now seeing as a yellow rose plants are quite expensive sometimes, we'll all chip in. A handful of you seemed really excited about the idea so we'll run it.<br /><br />What we'll do. Is first... hold off on the big donation fundraiser. I wanna be around 100% do to it, but I won't be until September. That will run from Sept till Christmas... which seems actually kinda good.<br /><br />I'm putting up a donation button at the BOTTOM of the post. Feel free to donate as much as you like. By Monday, we'll have a good indication as to where we sit financially on it and where exactly we're getting the flowers from and how much we need for it. Donations will close THURSDAY afternoon at the latest.<br /><br />I will be leaving Saturday for LA and will send it off the following week, while I'm there.<br /><br />I will be gone over the weekend to get some much needed rest, with a lake and foliage :] <span class='ljuser  ljuser-name_cluesby4' lj:user='cluesby4' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://cluesby4.livejournal.com/profile'><img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://cluesby4.livejournal.com/'><b>cluesby4</b></a></span> will be the one answering all questions concerning this mini flower donation thing, while I am gone. Seeing as it was her idea, she's helping me spear head this whole operation. :D (This is what happens when you come up with ideas, you help me see them through! :D haha)<br /><br />Seeing as we have a lot of people from both JAA and JFO, the flowers will be from both communities.<br /><br /><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"><br /><input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"/><br /><input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="7339458"/><br /><input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!"/><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"/><br /></form><br /><br /><br />If you have any other questions, e-mail me at admin@jorjaallaround.org. And I'll get to them Sunday night.<br /><br />Go Crazy ;]

There you have it!
