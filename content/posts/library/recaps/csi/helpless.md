## Synopsis

The discovery of a bludgeoned, bloody corpse inside a 'human hamster ball' (a six-foot tall, clear plastic ball) has the CSIs scratching their heads. Zach Fisk was a purveyor of the sexual arts, and made videos helping to teach people some ... exotic ways of orgasming. But Lady Heather he is not. Not only does Fisk die, but so does Melody Davis, his playmate.

Meanwhile, Sara and Morgan Brody team up with Dawn Banks (played by Sherry Stringfield) of swing shift to handle an unsolved, serial, rape case. Morgan realizes that the serial rape cases were actually all setups in order to rape the third victim, Amy Morse. In the middle of the case, Dawn goes missing after confronting their prime suspect, however it turns out she attempted suicide after receiving (incorrect) news her son was dead.

## Review

Sara goes over the case details with Morgan and D.B. Russell.
