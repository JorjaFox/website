So CSI is back.  Did you miss it?  We made it though a long summer with me being out of town more often than not. An iPad, by the way, isn't quite up to par for running JFO on the road, and internet is spotty in the deep Southern US.  

<h2>Important News</h2>
I've chatted with Jorja's assistant and have been assured that the 'JorjaFox' account on Twitter <strong>is not</strong> Jorja.  They're looking at having the account disabled for impersonation, though really all that account seems to want to do is tell you to join PETA and save the planet, it's not as bad as it could be.  Just remember, <em><a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/JorjaPedia:Troll">don't feed the trolls</a></em>.  Personally, I've blocked the account so I don't have to listen to it anymore.

<h2>CSI</h2>
We finally got news on the new season.  Some promo photos for  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x02-pool-shark-promotional-photos/">Ep 2 "Pool Shark"</a>, a video for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/promo-video-shock-wave/">Ep 1 "Shock Waves"</a> and press releases for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/press-release-blood-moon/">Ep 3 "Blood Moon"</a> and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/press-release-sqweegel/">Ep 4 "Sqweegel"</a>.

<strong>CSI Episodes</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Sept 23rd "Shock Waves" | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Shock_Waves">Recap</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season11/shockwaves/">Screencaps</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x01-shock-waves/">Discussion Post</a></li>
	<li>Sept 30th "Pool Shark" | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Pool_Shark">Recap</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season11/poolshark/">Screencaps</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x02-pool-shark/">Discussion Post</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Advocacy</h2>
Jorja sent a photo to a gallery with an original poem, to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorjas-art-poem-wolf-life/">raise money for the Wolf Conservation Center (WCC)</a>.

She then went to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-at-9-02-10-day/">9.02.10 Day</a> in Beverly Hills, where she was presented an <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/hsus-video-from-9-02-10-day/">award for her work for the Humane Society</a>.  Speaking of animals, Ali, her boxer, will be <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/ali-is-100-in-dog-years/">100 in October</a> (or 14 in human years).

Of course Jorja made the time to hit up the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-at-animal-acres-2010-gala/">Animal Acres Gala</a>, and looked as happy as ever to pose with fans.  She also was at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/peta-30th-anniversary-gala-photos/">PETA 30th Anniversary Gala</a>.

<h2>Community</h2>
Closer to home, JAA was a bit short on funds and needed some help, which it made in less than a week, so yay!  The more Jorja sites, the better, I say.  JFO is okay right now, though to keep being okay, I <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/videos-are-mostly-youtubed/">moved most of our videos to YouTube</a>.
