The farewell video has two quotes from Jorja:
<blockquote>Jorja: My grandmother had a line which I dedicate to CSI. It's one of my favorites of hers, things she used to say. "Honey. I may be a has-been, but look what I has been."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jorja: CSI, here's to you. May you live on, eternally, in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere.</blockquote>
