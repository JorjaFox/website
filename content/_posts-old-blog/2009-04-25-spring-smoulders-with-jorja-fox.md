Pictured in a lovely Tabitha Trench and Silver Embrace necklace, Jorja shows that you can be fashionable and eco-friendly all at the same time.

<blockquote>We were quickly drawn in by Jorja's strength, compassion, sultry good looks (which never hurts!) and unwaivering dedication to fair treatment and equal rights for all creatures - and we are honored to have her as such a prominent part of Green with Glamour!</blockquote>
