Liz Devine has been tweeting and FB'ing about tomorrow's CSI, and the more she does, the more interested I get. First of all, it's based on a real event, but more importantly it's _not_ a 'CSI in peril' episode.

As Liz said: "it's more about what you can come across when you work the field in law enforcement. I know--it happened to me!"

Also you can see her on the big screen as Dolores, the hotel manager.

Really, can you beat that hair?
