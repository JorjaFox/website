<a href="http://wordpress.org"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/06/blue-xl-100x100.png" alt="blue-xl" title="blue-xl" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1894" /></a> I'm firmly convinced that software people plan this.

WordPress 2.8 is out, and ready to go, so there's that. bbPress (the forums) are at 1.0rc2 which means nothing to you, but better integration for me. ZenPhoto's on 1.2.5 is out and just provides some more stable code for the gallery.

So there you have it. More upgrades of backend things. If you see weirdness, let me know!
