## Synopsis

Grissom is confronted with new evidence while on the stand of a murder trial of a restaurant owner. This development requires the reopening of the case and Eckley initiates an inquiry into Grissom and his team. The results of the inquiry lead to dramatic changes of the CSI team, with Catherine being promoted to head of the Swing Shift, with Warrick and Nick to work for her.

Note: Warrick states that swing shift starts at 4 (pm), meaning that Graveyard (Sara, Greg and Grissom) is from midnight to 8 am.

## Review

Sara remains on the night shift, with Grissom and Greg -- Ecklie moves those he considers 'safe' to Swing; as Sara has always stood up for Grissom, she stays on Graveyard.

## Notes

* Sara lies to Ecklie about having her required PEAP conversation with Grissom.
* Sara shows Greg how to raise an abraded serial number on a gun -- part of her mentoring of him that continues throughout the season.
* Ecklie considers Sara to be a trouble-maker (and unlikely to ever turn her back on Grissom, so she stays with the night shift.

## Quotes

**Ecklie:** Ah. As you know, it's my job to review everyone's file. I just want to make sure you finished up with your PEAP Counselor.\
**Sara:** That's none of your business, Ecklie.\
**Ecklie:** Well, not only is it my business, but I plan to speak with your supervisor.\
**Sara:** About what?\
**Ecklie:** You have updated him, right?\
**Sara:** Yeah, yeah, we've had an abbreviated conversation. I'm doing fine. Completed my required number of sessions months ago.\
**Ecklie:** Huh. Grissom failed to note that conversation in your file. Um ... But I'll take care of it. All right.\
**Sara:** Thanks.
