Avert your eyes if you don't want spoilers!

First to fuel your speculation of the death, we have this from [TV Line](http://tvline.com/2015/07/21/scandal-season-5-british-royalty-prince-princess-spoilers/)

> Did I already mention that a pivotal CSI character is getting killed off in the upcoming two-hour finale? (Technically, he/she will already be dead when the episode begins.)

I'm still betting Finn dies. It's pivotal. So I bet Finn dies and that's why DB leaves for Cyber. His wife never liked Las Vegas anyway.

And then we have this from [Ask Kristen (E!)](http://www.eonline.com/news/678080/spoiler-chat-scoop-on-american-horror-story-pretty-little-liars-arrow-the-mindy-project-and-more)

> Elena: What is going on with the CSI series finale movie? No George Eads and no Elisabeth Shue? Who's in this special?
> Remember Lindsey, Catherine Willows' daughter? Well, she's now in her early 20s and a CSI in training and she's very eager to help with the big case.

I would guess that Lindsey is the 'replacement' for Nick, since George bowed out of the finale. Now I wonder _which_ Lindsey (remember, they recast her).

And finally....
