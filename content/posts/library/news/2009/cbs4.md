The tenth season of "CSI" kicks off Thursday night and the season premiere marks the return of Sara Sidle. Sara comes back to help out the lab which is understaffed.

"It feels amazing to be back. It feels wonderful," exclaimed Jorja Fox who plays Sara. Her fellow cast mates agree.

"I'm very excited," said Marg Helgenberger who plays Catherine. "I love Jorja and I've missed her and she's so much fun. Just a real cool chick."

In the season premiere, the CSI team is at a crossroads. Catherine's leadership has been questioned and Sara has come in to help ease Catherine's workload.

"We're shorthanded, I'm told. I've asked for some help and I'm told we're bringing you somebody new," said Helgenberger.

When Sara shows up, she realizes the "new" person is really someone who is quite qualified.

And now that Catherine is in charge, tensions may mount.

"Sara hasn't always been completely comfortable with anyone in the authority track; but there's been some changes in Sara's life. She got married to Grissom.

Getting back into CSI mode has been a breeze for Jorja Fox. "My big line today is &#8216;hi guys', and I'm like all right, I think I can do that, I think I can pull it off."

Fox says there's something unique to CSA and it's still thrilling after all this time to just get to be a part of it.

CBS primetime kicks off tonight at 8:00 p.m. with "Survivor: Samoa", followed by "CSI", and then the season premiere of "The Mentalist."
