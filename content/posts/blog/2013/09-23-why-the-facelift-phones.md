It's like I'm never satisfied. It's actually been 21 months since a re-do, and this time it was for one major goal.

**Mobile**

Last year, about 17% of people visited JFO on a mobile device (including tablets). This year? 35% That's crazy! And given how many people are picking up iPhones and Androids, it's silly for me to not take this into consideration. Of course this isn't my forte, and while I could default to using some fancy code to redirect everyone on a mobile to a special version of the site, I'd been struggling with using responsive CSS for a while. Finally someone else did the heavy lifting. The same champion who made those wonderful header images for me helped out and did the theme. I'm tweaking the CSS here and there, but it's nice to have something done-done.

Behind the scenes, there's been a lot of recoding to make everything better. Now the site is HTML5, HDMI friendly, responsive, faster, and easily swappable. That last bit is important so the theme can be _easily_ updated. Now instead of having to sweat and re-do everything three times, it's really as simple and changing a file. It keeps (almost) everything in sync the right way. The only downside is no support for IE 7 (which impacts .006% of you), however I think it's reasonable to suggest you upgrade, or download another browser.

Oh and, of course, it's Green.

There aren't any new 'features' for that, but a reminder of what is, perhaps, my favorite feature that we already have, before the new _CSI_ season, is in order! _Download zips of images! _Some people missed this and have been trying to use browser add ons to download every image on a page. Doing that is really tough on a server, so instead, why not just click on this link:

<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-8489" alt="download-zip" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/09/download-zip.png" width="600" height="201" />

That's right! That will let you download a zip of every single image in a folder. Everything that I can remove watermarks on, I have, and if I can find better versions of images, I update them too. If you use the images on your site, just site your source.

I'm pretty much open to your ideas of what I can offer you guys to make your fandom easier.

If you want a funny visual, imagine me sprinting around trying to find all the mobile devices I can to test this on.
