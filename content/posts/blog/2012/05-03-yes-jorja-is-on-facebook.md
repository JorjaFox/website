<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4602" title="Facebook" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/05/facebook-230x153.jpg" alt="Facebook" width="230" height="153" />

In a recent interview, Jorja said she _does_ have a Facebook page.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JorjaFoxworldwide">https://www.facebook.com/JorjaFoxworldwide</a>

That is, officially, her page. It's 'broken' right now she says (which I suspect means she's having FB issues, and if so, Jorja, have your people ping me, you know I'm willing to help out!)

She has messaging turned on but _**please**_ don't spam her. Be cool, be nice, and be respectful.
