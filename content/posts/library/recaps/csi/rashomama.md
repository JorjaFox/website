## Synopsis

Solving the case of wealthy defense attorney Diane Chase -- killed at her son's wedding -- is compromised when all of the evidence from the case is stolen along with Nick's car, while he, Greg and Sara are having breakfast at their traditional restaurant (the same as seen in "The Strip Strangler" back in season one).

Confined to the lab until Internal Affairs arrives, and without the evidence, the three reconstruct the case from their memories and the videographer's DVD of the event. They initially assume that whomever stole the car also killed Diane, however it was really the bridesmaids, acting in cahoots, who accidently killed Diane and covered it up. By the time Internal Affairs arrives to take their statements, the case has been solved, and the criminals confessed.

Much of the episode is told via flashbacks, and everyone's version of the event has a different feel. Sara's seems to be anti-wedding, while Nick embraces the sappier side of marriage. Grissom and Brass are very cut and dried, but Greg is a nearly over-the-top film noir. The name of the episode is a play on the movie, Rashomon, which revolves around the issue that, due to differeing witness accounts, it can be impossible to discern the truth.

At the end of the episode, Grissom states that it doesn't matter which one of them Internal Affairs speaks with first, as their stories will all be the same.

## Review

There is a duality to Sara in this episode -- she goes from pessimistic and negative (voicing her opposition to tradition, her commentary on marriage) to humorous and cheerful (the guy flirting with her, comments to Nick). She doesn't like people who blindly follow traditions -- demonstrating some 'Grissom-esque' recall on the subject of marriage -- but she also says that she's not anti-wedding. While waiting for IAB, she takes a nap in the locker room (face down on the bench), and is enthusiastic when Catherine wakes her to process the car. Despite the situation -- stolen evidence and an IAB investigation -- she doesn't let herself get frustrated.

## Notes

* Sara (and Greg) maxed out on overtime.
* Sara is not anti-wedding, but anti-stupid. She dislikes people following traditions merely for the sake of tradition.
* Sara actually knows about the history of weddings, including the fact that bridesmaids dressed like the bride to confuse evil spirits.
* As has been noted before, Sara doesn't mind when guys flirt with her, even if it is a drunken guy at the reception; she takes it all in stride and may appreciate the attention.
* Sara is familiar with author Raymond Chandler's work.
