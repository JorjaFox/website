Implying that there were 'grumblings' behind William Peteresen's departure and tension with Gary Dourdan and Jorja Fox when they left is par for the course.  When someone wants to leave a job, they usually aren't the most fun to be around because they're ready to be gone, after all.

But then he dropped this bombshell:
<blockquote>I miss Jorja, but having [Lauren Lee Smith] here, not being a diva, not being insecure, just doing a good job and being a really sweet person â€¦ We're lucky to have [her].</blockquote>

Clearly a lot of this is open to interpenetration, but questions **5, 6, 8 and 9** are fairly eye-brow raising.  Read the whole article at aol.com and form your own opinions: <a href="http://television.aol.com/insidetv/2009/03/03/14-questions-with-george-eads/">14 Questions With: George Eads</a>
