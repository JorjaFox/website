Both George Eads and Jorja Fox are expecting to still be part of the **CSI: Crime Scene Investigation** cast for the fifth season, stating their firings last week was one big misunderstanding. CBS reportedly let the two actors go for breach of contract. Reports said they had asked for more money to stay on the show.

Eads, who played Nick Stokes on the popular show, tells the Associated Press that the reason he didn't show up on-time the first day of filming was because he overslept. He hoped what he called a "big misunderstanding" with CBS and its chief, Leslie Moonves, will be resolved by the end of the week and he will be back to work on the hit drama.

"Yeah, definitely, I look forward to going back," he told a Television Critics Association meeting on Wednesday. He was on hand to publicize his upcoming TV movie **Evel Knievel**, airing July 30 on TNT.

Meanwhile, Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, will for sure rejoin the show, says E! News Live. Fox was let go last Wednesday, it was said, because she had not met a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, to continue to report for work, ongoing contract hassles or no.

The actress was said to be "mystified" by her firing, because she believed she'd sent in her letter in time. *E!* said the Fox matter was ruled a misunderstanding, clearing the way for her return.

Shooting on the show's fifth season was to have begun last week, but cameras never got rolling.
