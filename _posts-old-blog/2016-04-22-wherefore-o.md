A lot of you had opinions that were quiet. I got a lot of emails and feedbacks and comments and DMs and ...

Well the O was silly. And limiting and now we're Fans of LeFox. And we have a fox!

Twitter is @LeFoxFans but don't worry, everyone's magically following the right account. I'll set up a redirect on the old one as soon as I figure that out. Facebook isn't changing since it can't. Other things will be slowly sorted out.

Things that won't change? The static site URL (<code>jfo-static.net</code>)Â and the short URLs (<code>jfo4.us</code>) since those are behind the scenes for the most part and I highly doubt I'll find URLs as cool as those again. Also they're resources only. You probably never even notice them.
