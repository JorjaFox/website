The parallels with Sam and Brass this episode were heartbreaking, and Paul kicked it out of the park tonight. This was amazing.

On the Sara front, she had a decent amount of screentime in the front half of the episode, and did a lot of the legwork. That she had a geek crush on Sam for his skills was entirely and utterly Sara-Appropriate. That's our science geek.

I'm <em>really</em> going to miss Paul. It's just painful.
