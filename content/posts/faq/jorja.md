### Who is Jorja Fox?

Jorja Fox is an actor, producer, activist and musician.

She is most well known for her TV work, having played the recurring role of Dr. Maggie Doyle on the NBC show _ER_ from 10/10/1996 through 01/21/1999, the guest role of Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on NBC's _The West Wing_ from 02/24/2000 through 09/2000, and the regular role of Sara Sidle on CBS's _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_.

She has also been seen in movies and award shows, and is an environmentalist and humanitarian who attends many outreach causes. For her other roles, see her filmography. For more about her background, read her biography.

### What's the deal with her name?

This question arises since Jorja Fox was listed as 'Jorjan Fox' in her first few movies, on Missing Persons, and on her first few episodes of _ER_. After a few episodes, her listing changed to 'Jorja Fox'. The confusion was compounded by the following rumor:

>When [Jorja] joined the cast of _ER_, her name was shortened back to Jorja after a couple episodes, hence the confusion. In an interview she said that one day she woke up and wanted her name back.

The rumor is arguable, and not verifiable.

Her birth name is 'Jorja-An' and Jorja is a shortening. Jorjan was bastardization of Jorja-An that was done when she was on _Missing Persons_.

Today, both personally and professionally, she is known as 'Jorja Fox'.
