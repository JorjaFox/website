If you're wondering whether Gil Grissoms's heart remains in Las Vegas, you'll finally get an answer on February 20. In the *CSI* episode titled "Forget Me Not," the long-distance - and recently troubled - marriage between Sara (**Jorja Fox**) and Gil (**William Petersen**, who was last seen on the show via a Skype conversation in 2011) will hit a *major* turning point. Divorce or reunion? Fox won't spill, but she's glad fans of the romance will get some resolution. "You can't leave a pivotal story suspended forever," the actress tells EW. "All of these characters around her are enjoying flirtations and romances. Sara is too young to sleep alone!"
