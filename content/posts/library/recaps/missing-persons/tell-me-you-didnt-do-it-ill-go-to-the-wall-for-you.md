## Synopsis

Ellen is making her mark on the department, buying doughnuts, making coffee, and being paired with Bobby on a seemingly straightforward parolee disappearance. Until Bobby is framed.

## Review

Connie looks into the case of David Roberts, 21-year old who is missing ten days from an upper Lakeview apartment. Mrs. Roberts explains that she and her son hadn't talked in 3 years after his father threw him out for being gay. The mother finally got the courage to leave her husband and find David. The residents of David's building are secretive and evasive, giving Connie few leads save his boss. While David has no phone, his boss has the number for a contact service. Connie gets in touch with David via the service and tells him she's looking for him on behalf of his mother, and David hangs up on her. They're able to trace his call to his apartment complex, where Connie tracks him down only to find he's run off again. Since she can't reunite mother and son, she instead gives his mother all the information she has.

## Notes

## Quotes

**Connie:** A few months ago I probably wouldn't have even known who you were, but my new boyfriend takes me to all these art exhibits, and I've actually seen your work. It's really interesting.
