<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/12/creepyfan.jpg" alt="" title="creepyfan" width="230" height="200" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2825" /> This is slightly off topic, and apropos only of the people squeeing like fangirls at poor @MarleeMatlin about being on CSI (and acting with Jorja).  A friend of mine posted a pretty awesome reminder to some fans to not be that creepy fan.  It was so spot-on that I asked her if I could cross-post here, even though i know not all of you are watching _Rizzoli & Isles_ (and I really want Jorja to guest on it so I can have even more of an excuse to watch that show!).  The idea of **not** being a creepy fan is true of all fandoms!

<blockquote>[...]

Don’t be a creepy fan.

Now, I’m not suggesting that we are all creepy fans.. Most of us are the normal kind of obsessed fan that squeals when Angie, Sasha, Paulie, Jeri, or whomever gives us a quick tweet hello. That’s all groovy. I’ve been there. I’ve done my share of dancing around like an idiot because Sasha Alexander said “hello” to a tweet I made where she was tagged.

I totally get that.

However, there comes a time when you just have to chill. I mean, these people that we drool, fawn, and perv on are people, too. They have their own lives, families, communities, interests, and feelings. They _are not_ their characters. Angie may play a badass cop. Jeri may play an ice princess Borg. But, that’s not them.

You can read her full rant (which is barely a rant) on her <a href="http://admhawthorne.tumblr.com/post/2348184658/rant">Tumblr</a> account.  It struck me as something we could all use a reminder of.  Actors are people too!  Sure, we all get a rush when they talk to us, but in many ways, I'm really happy Jorja isn't out and about on Twitter or FaceBook or any of these sites.  The mad crush of people swarming me (thinking I'm Jorja) is crazy.  I can imagine how nutsy it gets for the celebs.

I would only add to Liv's rant a reminder than not being a creepy fan means you don't be a creepy fan to other fans too!  I'd be very happy if I never got another email telling me what, exactly, you wanted to do with Jorja, or how personally tormented you were after she left CSI. Really, thanks, I'm good.  There are some things you can't un-see, and those missives are on my list.

We also chatted about using our 'power' on Twitter for good, so I'll remind you that we're $37 dollars away from being able to pay for Jorja the pig (at Animal Acres) for a whole year!  Use your powers for good and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-animalacres2010/fundraiser/jorjafoxonline">donate to Animal Acres now</a>.  Or before January 15th.  Either way works.
