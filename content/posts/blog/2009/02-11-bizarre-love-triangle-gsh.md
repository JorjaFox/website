AOL's Liane Bonin  counts down the top 20 Prime Time TV love triangles. Pinging in at number 20 is Sara and Grissom ... and Lady Heather.

> **20. Gil/Sara/Lady Heather, 'CSI'**
>
> **History:** Forensic examiner Gil Grissom (William Petersen) isn't exactly lucky with the ladies. Dominatrix-turned-therapist Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) only comes into his life when she's a murder suspect, when her daughter is murdered and when her kinky past is helpful to Grissom in solving a case. As for his subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), their relationship is only hinted at until he proposes in season 8.
>
> **Outcome:** Sara gets cold feet, fleeing town and leaving behind little more than a note. Not surprisingly, Grissom turns to Lady Heather for ... support.

They conveniently left out the real outcome: Grissom packs his bags for the jungle to find Sara.
