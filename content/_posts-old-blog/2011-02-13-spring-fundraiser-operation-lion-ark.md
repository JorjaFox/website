Last time it was JFO raising money for Animal Acres.  This time, the Spring Fundraiser is for the ADI - Animal Defenders International - who are rescuing circus lions.  Think about how much your cat eats.  Now scale that up to a lion.  Now multiply it by 25.  Yeah, that's expensive!  In her recent interview, Jorja mentioned that CSI lets her have time off to go to Denver to see these lions she's helped

<blockquote>As we all know, Jorja actively supports ADI, and is currently very much involved with Operation: Lion Ark, in which ADI has successfully secured twenty-five ex-circus lions from Bolivian circuses. They are on their way to an animal sanctuary in Denver, Colorado, where ADI will support them for the rest of their natural lives. Unfortunately, as one can imagine, this is a very expensive process.

ADI is actively seeking donations of any and all amounts, so I have decided to host this fundraiser for them! The money will all go directly to ADI, and will be sent in memory of Jorja's dog of fourteen years, Ali. The project is hosted through CrowdRise, which takes less money than PayPal, and is also tax deductible.

The goal is currently set at $800, and I think we can do it, guys! As of right now, the deadline for the fundraiser is April 25, 2011.

There is a practical reason for the teams, though.  First healthy competition breeds
