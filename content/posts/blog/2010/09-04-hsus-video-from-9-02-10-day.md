Partial Transcript:
<blockquote>Wayne Pacelle: Well, we're here in Beverly Hills, at the Taste of Beverly Hills.  This is a dinner and Gala and event that we're actually giving out three advocates awards to celebrities who are great supporters of the Humane Society and great advocates for animal protection.

[...]

Jorja Fox: I think for me, right now, especially in leiu of the Gulf disaster and I'm very concerned with the world's oceans and the state of the fishing indisutry today, those are issues that are really important to me, I'm also personally, really concerned with zoos and circuses.  If I had my way, traveling circuses would become a thing of the past, the same way as lead paint and asbestos has become a thing of the past. I think we've all evolved beyond them.

Wayne Pacelle: Beverly Hills has always been an outstanding advocate for animal protection.  So we're priviledged, very priviledged to be here, so we're going to recognize three of our outstanding supporters.  Three celebrities who are doing great work, not only in this community but all across the country.  We are giving out Animal Advocate Awards to these ambasadors for the community and for animal protection.

[...]

Jorja Fox: What an amazingly festive and fun event. Thank you, Mr. Mayor for throwing this party, thank you, Humane Society. Beverly Hills is a glamorus city, it's a beautify city, it's a city of good fortune and where American dreams are realized.  And I think it's a testament to this city to have the Humane Society here tonight.  It shows Beverly Hills is also a compassionate city and a very kind and progressive looking city.  Thank you.
