<em>Update to note: This was a ROUGH DRAFT which CBS did not want to get out, apparently.  As we all know by now, Fishburne's not coming back to CSI.  So ... no one knows what this means for Jorja yet.  Her contract is still being negotiated.</em>

A one sheet is just what it sounds like.  One sheet of paper about a TV show.

In CBS's case, they're incapable of spelling both Jorja Fox or Sara Sidle correctly in the same press-release.  Twelve years.

Seriously, guys. Sara **Sidel**?  If you need a proofreader, I'm for hire!

It's sad that the spelling caught my attention more than the fact that, hey, wait a second, Jorja's listed on there to begin with!  I think signs are green for another season with Sara <del>Sidel</del> Sidle.  Oh, shuckey darn!  I did it too!

By the way, no I don't know if this means Jorja's back for all of season 12, but given that the "Two and a Half Men" sheet had Ashton Kutcher instead of Charlie Sheen, my GUESS is that Jorja was the last person to sign up, and they quickly tossed her name on the bottom.
