On "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," forensics expert Sara Sidle's specialty is element and materials analysis. So, who better to gather some behind-the-scenes material of the hit CBS series than the woman who plays the ambitious investigator - actress JORJA FOX.

"'The Insider' has given me a camera," Jorja says directly into the lens as she prepares to record every single second of her work day. The result? A video diary that captures candid, albeit tongue-in-cheek, moments of her fellow cast mates.

"Are you gonna tape everything we say?" Jorja's co-star WILLIAM PETERSEN playfully asks.

Absolutely William! Not to mention an exclusive tour of Jorja's trailer, where she hangs with her dogs in between scenes. "You can see the remnants of a long nine months," says the celebrity videographer as her camera pans the interior.

Then it's off to where all the magic takes place -"This is the set of 'CSI.' This is Santa Clarita [Studios]. This is where we film 'CSI'" - before having some fun with her stand-in. "Is that Jorja Fox?" Jorja teases, as her likeness runs away. "It's Jorja Fox!"

And like a sister impishly antagonizing her kid brother, Jorja relentlessly follows ERIC SZMANDA, who portrays scientist Greg Sanders. "You're just not going to give up, are you?" Eric asks with a smile.

Nope. At least not until she dishes the dirt about a famous film director who's visiting the set before creating the season finale. "It's a two-hour episode of 'CSI' directed by QUENTIN TARANTINO."

Good work, Jorja!
