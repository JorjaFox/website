<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5877" title="Forever Dusty" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/11/foreverdusty-276x140.png" alt="Forever Dusty" width="276" height="140" />Forever Dusty is on Broadway!

Off Broadway, really, but it's there and it opens tonight. Kristen Holly Smith leads an amazing cast in the story of Dusty Springfield, now on the big stage where it's going to get some more attention.

Get tickets from <a href="http://www.broadway.com/shows/forever-dusty/">Broadway.com</a> if you happen to be in NYC. Irony? I'm now even further away!
