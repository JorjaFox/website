## Synopsis

The forensics reality show _Hard Crime_ follows the CSIs as they work on the rape case of Christina Hollis. Raped in the very condo building she worked and lived in, Christina had been tied to her bed by duct tape and assaulted by Richard McQueen, a man posing as a fireman. The rapist's MO was to light smoke bombs in the building, knock on the door of a woman, knock her out with the lorazepam and to rape her over hours, multiple times. Additionally, Richard had a foot fetish.

At some point during the rape, Christina's quasi-boyfriend came by with flowers, but when he found the door was locked and heard Barry White playing, he assumed she'd moved on and threw the flowers down in a huff.
Christina was unable to remember a great number of details, but said she didn't paint her nails, which were currently painted ruby red.

it's via the trace evidence of a scrap of cloth from Richard's fireman uniform that the CSIs can pin the disguise down. But the outfit isn't a perfect match to the materials used by the Las Vegas Fire Department, and quickly it's determined the fake-fireman is also the same man who set smoke bombs in another apartment building. As it turns out, that was a smoke test, as Richard was seeing how well his disguise worked. His first 'attack' had been on a woman whom he'd spied from his balcony, doing yoga on her own balcony. A month previously, he'd met her at a bar, drugged her, took her home and given her a pedicure.

In Richard's apartment, all the evidence needed to pin him to the crimes was there, except Ricard. He was busy setting the smoke bombs for his next victim. The fourth and final victim he killed, because she wouldn't let him touch her feet. The real firemen caught Richard trying to flee, and proceeded to beat the shit out of him.

## Review

It's not surprising that Sara has a strong dislike to rape. When asked if her following a lead on a cold case is as helpful as another rape victim, in terms of finding evidence, Sara says she'd rather it not come to that.
