It's clearly a 1990s sort of show, and everything from costuming to dialogue echos that so strongly, it's nearly the sort of show I'd make a drinking game of.  The cases are actually interesting, but the production shows it's age.  At seventeen years and counting, it strongly reminds me of the TV I used to watch back them.  There are a couple <em>ER</em> actors that popped up, like Nurse Chuney as one of the other cop's wife, and the whole thing was filmed on location.  A very amusing look back on Chicago.

If I get the chance, I'll update the quality of the screencaps as well, though that's a lot of work. Ditto videos. It may be something for those slow weeks of no Jorja on CSI, eh?
