Animal Defenders International Media Briefing/Photo Opportunity/Record Breaking Rescued Bolivian Lion Arrival**

A world record breaking airlift carrying 25 lions rescued by Animal Defenders International (ADI) following Bolivia's ban on animal circuses is scheduled to arrive at Denver International Airport via TAB Airlines on Wednesday, February 16, 2011 at approximately **2:00 p.m.** This event is open to the media only; please see RSVP instructions below.

The lions will then travel to The Wild Animal Sanctuary (TWAS) in Keenesburg, CO where they will be released into the first phase of what will be a wonderful new 80 acre purpose built enclosure. The lions that were seized during the last three months by ADI from deplorable conditions in circuses will taste freedom in Colorado. The lions range from cubs of just three months old to an elderly lion aged 15.

CSI actress Jorja Fox will be participating in the rescue operation along with TV personality Bob Barker, who funded the rescue. Fox, Barker and other ADI personnel are available to brief media about the operation and journey from Bolivia in advance of the arrival. Spanish spokespersons are also available.
