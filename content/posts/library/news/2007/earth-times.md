Hollywood actress Jorja Fox is reportedly planning to leave the popular police procedural, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."

E! News has reported that Fox's character, Sara Sidle, will not be on the show after this season's seventh episode.

TV Guide has also said Fox will be leaving the long-running series in November.

The actress has reportedly been having more trouble negotiating her contract with CBS.

She was fired and rehired after a high-profile contract dispute in 2004.
