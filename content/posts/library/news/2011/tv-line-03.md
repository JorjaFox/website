Something tells me Sara/Grissom fans will not want to miss next week's *CSI*.

The following promotional clip from the Feb. 3 episode - which finds Jorja Fox's Sara working through some issues with her disapproving mother-in-law - strongly suggests that William Petersen's MIA Grissom will figure into the family squabble.

But will William Petersen actually be making an appearance - as CSI Files is reporting? Or will Grissom remain an off screen presence? A *CSI* spokesperson declined to comment. My gut, however, advises you to tune in.

Watch the clip and you tell me: Do you think Grissom will turn up next week? Or am I reading too much into it?
