Now that Ausiello is on EW, and it's Wednesday, is anyone surprised?

> **Question: Please set the record straight. Is Jorja Fox doing just the season premiere of CSI, or will she be in additional episodes?  — Shane**

> **Ausiello:** I don’t want to give away the exact number, so let’s just say she’s doing two more than Gary Dourdan and seven less than William Petersen.

Gary is doing one episode and William is doing ten. That means Jorja? Has three. The original spoilers said she was doing three, and then it said five, and I personally started to wonder if she was doing ‘batches’ and was going to have three visits over multiple episodes. Having not seen all the scripts, I think we can say with 100% certainty that Jorja will be on CSI for three episodes, minimum.
