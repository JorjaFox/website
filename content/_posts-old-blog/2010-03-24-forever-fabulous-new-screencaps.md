<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/03/foreverfab-001.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/03/foreverfab-001-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="foreverfab-001" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2316" /></a> Thanks to the magic of the internet, there are now better quality screencaps (slightly larger and far less grainy) of Jorja Fox in the should-have-been-cult-classic <em>Forever Fabulous</em> (with Jean Smart, Jennifer Elise Cox, Emily Procter, Jack Plotnick, Mink Stole, Jorja Fox, and Robert Wagner).

If you've forgotten the plot, the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Forever_Fabulous">JorjaPedia</a> has you covered.  This one is the beauty queen road trip about mother and daughter pageant pros going back home to Texas for a shot a redemption. Jorja's Liz Guild is wonderfully clumsy and naive, and the movie is a laugh a minute.  Perhaps it's not on par with <em>The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</em> or <em>To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar</em>, and certainly the title is shorter, but <em>Forever Fabulous</em> was certainly a fun way to spend the afternoon.

Later this week, I'll upload videos clips of Jorja's scenes for you to enjoy.
