After eight seasons on one of TV's highest-rated shows, Jorja Fox left the CBS drama "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" Thursday night.

Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the hot TV series, has told several publications that she decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests.

"It's one of the hardest decisions I've made in my life," Fox told Entertainment Weekly. "It has nothing to do with my contract, nothing to do with money. ... It could be the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Only time will tell."

Fox had a history of butting heads with CBS brass over contract negotiations and was fired in 2004 before coming to an agreement with the network.

After that, her status on the show was the source of rampant rumors up until she confirmed her departure last month.
