I hesitate at embedding these, since CBS's track record of not deleting them has been... slim. (CBS you need to hire an Internet savvy person and tell them that rule 1 is "Stop deleting videos you put up on your own website.")Â But let's trust CBS for a day, and look at all the pretty videos we have of Sara!

You can go and look at these on your own at cbs.com, but I'm collecting them by episode for you, and I'll push them out every couple days, to keep us all Sara Excited. First, let's have the onesy-twosy episode clips:
