That's weird, since you can totally access the video from Canada.

<em>Edited: The video is now embeddable. Click the credit link if you can't see the video below.</em>

<blockquote>D.B. Russell leads the CSI team on a hunt to find Morgan and Ellie Brass following their kidnapping by a ritualistic killer, on the 14th season premiere of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION.</blockquote>
Does it strike anyone else as odd that they're putting in "CSI:" but not "Crime Scene Investigation"? I mean... why bother with the colon? I'm looking at the wrong things again, aren't I?
