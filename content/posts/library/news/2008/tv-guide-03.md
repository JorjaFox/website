"CSI" boss Carol Mendelsohn wasn't pulling my leg when she told me last October that we haven't seen the last of Sara Sidle. Sources confirm that Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return for the show's ninth-season premiere next fall.

Specifics of her comeback are being kept under lock and key, but my "CSI" mole assures me that she "won't be appearing in a flashback." The likely scenario has Sara returning to Vegas to ~~shag Grissom~~ mourn ex-colleague Warrick, who was shot (and presumably) killed in last week's finale. I say "presumably" because in the current issue of "TV Guide", Mendelsohn says Gary Dourdan will be back in the fall -- and "not just in flashbacks."

I've got three words for you: Gut-wrenching death scene.

For more on Fox's "CSI" return, pick up next week's season finale fallout-themed issue of TV Guide, which I'm hearing is a veritable spoilerpalooza!
