Stephen J. Cannell, who came up with [Missing Persons](/library/actor/missing-persons/) passed away on October first as well.  If you want to watch the show, you can pick up the "Prime Time Crime: Stephen J. Cannell Collection" DVD box set. And yes, that high pitched voice is Jorja!

I think it's pretty safe to say that without that first, albeit failed, series under her belt, we may never have gotten to know Jorja on _ER_, _The West Wing_ or _CSI_
