## Synopsis

Warrick heads the investigation of the murder of a con artist who turns out to be involved with Brass' daughter, and the evidence leads Sara on a counterfeit investigation.

With Grissom away, Warrick is in charge for the first time as the team investigates the murder of the con artist, who has run off with some tourists' money only to get shot and killed in the parking lot. The prime suspect in the case turns out to be Captain Brass' daughter, which causes Brass to take himself off the investigation professionally, but not personally.

Meanwhile, the physical evidence in the case leads Sara to investigate a high-end counterfeit operation after the money found on the victim turns out to be bogus.

## Review

Sara doesn't get angry when she discovers that the Feds were testing her with the bogus money.

## Notes

* Sara is a little upset at being passed over as temporary shift supervisor, though she has never shown an interest in command.

## Quotes

**Grissom:** If it was a matter of seniority, I'd give it to Nick. If I needed someone who could stay up three nights in a row, I'd give it to Sara.
