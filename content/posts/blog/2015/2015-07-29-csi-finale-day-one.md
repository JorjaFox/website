Yes, Waldeck posted it on Monday, but here's a little "Buzz Kill" flashback:

And now on to the finale! Everything from here on down could be a spoiler. I'm going to be tagging posts with spoiler, so please pay attention. If you don't want to know, back out now!

First up, Lindsey Willows has been recast.

<a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/29/csi-katie-stevens-series-finale">Katie Stevens will play CSI Level 1 Lindsey Willows</a>.

<blockquote>
  Now in her early 20s, Lindsey is a CSI level 1 experiencing her first day on the job. Lindsey is described as an over-caffeinated, younger and bubbly version of her mom, minus a youthful mistake or two, who is on her way to a promising career. Lindsey actually nails down a key piece of evidence that moves the case forward.
</blockquote>

Remember when Lindsey really wanted a Razor Scooter and Catherine wouldn't get it for her because of the kid who died riding one? My how things have changed.

I bumped into Louis when I was on set (I was just reminded of this! So sorry, Louis, I'm bad with names and faces. That's why I work on the Internet. ? ).

Officially official. The title is Immortality. Perhaps it's in reference to leaving a legacy behind. We are all immortal in memories. Only time will tell how immortal _CSI_ is.

Here's the first shot of the finale:

I think that's Jon Wellner, Elisabeth Harnois, and Wally Langham.

And here's something ... Lady Heather related?

I mean, who else has whips and chains?

Meanwhile, Grissom will have new glasses:

Those are pretty nerdy, Grissom.

Other staffers are happy to be back:

Even if it's bittersweet:

But Marg is looking like Marg:
