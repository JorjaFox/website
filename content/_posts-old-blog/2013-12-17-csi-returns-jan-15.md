By the way, CSI will shortly be on a break on and off screen. As of this weekend, they're off for the holidays and should be back on set early/mid January. If we're lucky, we'll get some promo pictures of Jorja, but so far the stills from CSI files are of <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/12/csi-first-look-additional-photos-from-keep-calm-and-carry-on/">Finn, Brass, and DB</a>.
