SARA lives.

Lab tech Sara Sidle sur vived last season's cliffhanger ending of "**CSI: Crime Scene Investigation**," fans of the show learned last night in the premiere episode of the series' eighth season.

The survival of Sara, who was left to die in the Las Vegas desert by the serial murderer known as "the miniature killer" - for the miniature models of crime scenes she would build and leave for CSI investigators - means cast member Jorja Fox will be sticking around for a while on the top-rated CBS drama.

Fox's future was in doubt last season as she refused to show up for shooting the season finale because she reportedly feared "CSI" producers were planning to kill off her character.

A salary dispute was said to be the real reason for the stand-off, which also involved co-star George Eads.

CBS refused to say whether Fox will stick around for the entire season.
