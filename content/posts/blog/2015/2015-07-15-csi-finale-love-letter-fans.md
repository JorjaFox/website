Having been inspired by the Discovery Channel to create _CSI_, Anthony Zuiker is now working on the finale.

> Right now, Zuiker's attention is squarely on wrapping up the show that Discovery helped inspire: Later this month, he'll start production on CSI's two-hour series finale. While the show's future seemed murky last season, Zuiker wasn't informed of its fate until shortly before CBS' upfront in May. "A finale is not something that is given too often in this business, so I'm relishing the opportunity," he said.
>
> "It is a love letter to the fans," Zuiker said of the finale, which will bring back the show's original stars, William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger. "It's a complicated and rich case that brings all of our people back together, and has a very satisfactory conclusion that life will go on. And there's many, many takeaways that I think our audience will appreciate. If you are a devoted fan, you'll be very, very pleased emotionally how things wrap up. And if you're a new fan, I think you'll find yourself in for a two-hour ride."
