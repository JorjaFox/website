## Synopsis

The CSIs are on zombie alert when two men initially pronounced dead mysteriously come back to life. The first dead body walks out of the morgue, while the second is found in an alley and vanishes by the time CSI gets there. The CSIs trace the evidence to Dr. Elliot Davis Aden, a discredited psychoanalyst who worked for the government during the Red Scare, until he fell into the lure of drugs.

Dr. Aden also conducted re-animation experiments. When they go back to Dr. Aden's closed lab on UNLV campus, they find that people have been performing 'independent study' into Dr. Aden's work on death. When the CSIs find the ID and wearable camcorder of Max Ferris (the morgue zombie), one of the 'dead' men, they learn he and his friends, Kurt Dawson (the alley zombie) and Alice Katsu, took drugs to simulate death. Kurt's body is found in Dr. Aden's old sensory deprivation tank on campus.

They finally find Max at the grave of Alice's mother, hoping to find Alice. When they try to arrest him, he runs and is killed by a car. Alice, as it happens, was in contact with Dr. Aden, and was picked up by him whilst on her trip. The CSIs determine that Dr. Aden was providing Alice with the drugs and documents, and now, following the death of her two compatriots, took a large dose of the drugs, rendering himself comatose.

At long last, they find Alice. Having returned to the campus, Alice went to Dr. Aden's old lab and is alive and well. She hallucinated seeing her mother, and felt better, totally unaware of the death of Kurt and Max.

## Review

Sara processes the alley where the second body walks away. She and Ray go to talk to Dr. Aden, bringing him back to the lab. Later, Sara and Catherine investigate Alice's house. Sara's very friendly with and amused by Dr. Aden.
