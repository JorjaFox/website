The Traveling Exotic Animal and Public Safety Protection Act (**TEAPSPA**) would prohibit the use of wild animals in traveling shows such as circuses. The amount of cruelty towards animals in those venues is staggering.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">... some people think that circuses are educational, when in fact all they do is teach people how _**not**_ to treat animals. They set a terrible example that it's okay to keep animals in cages and on chains, and deprive them from a natural life of social interaction, of enrichment, of families, of sustainable habitats. All of this, simply, for people's amusement.<cite><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/2021/1117-teapspa/">Jorja Fox - TEAPSA Launch</a></cite></blockquote>
