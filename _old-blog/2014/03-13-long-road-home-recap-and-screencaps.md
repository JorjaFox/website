Everyone was equal in this episode and if I graded it, it would be three stars for _everyone_ of the main cast. I also greatly enjoyed the episode because... well I was there. Sorry about the first half of the episode on Twitter getting pretty much live tweeted by me, I was just bouncing about it. It was my Fame Experience, as it were.

My only disappointment was that the joke about Nick having a mullet in his band was cut. Jorja was funny when she delivered the line. I wish she'd get a chance to do some comedy again, because ... well she's good at it!
