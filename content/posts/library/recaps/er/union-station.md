## Summary

Susan's last day in the ER finds Mark unsure of himself. Despite Doug's urgings, Mark still finds himself afraid to admit his feelings for her. He chases her all over the city until he finds her at the train station. He declares his love for her, but she decides to leave for Phoenix anyway. Grabarsky and Lydia finally get married. Carol agrees to become 'management' in exchange for an end to the policy of floating ER nurses elsewhere. Al Boulet delivers divorce papers to Jeanie. Doyle calls the cops on a pregnant woman who is drunk and trying to kill her unborn baby. Charlie brings a neighbor's baby into the Healthmobile.

## Review

Early in the episode, Doyle is impressed and intimidated by Susan's skills, who assures Doyle that she too was green once. She also takes a case during Lydia's impromptu wedding. Later on, Doyle shows her worth when a highly intoxicated, full-term pregnant woman, is brought to the ER, ranting about how she's going to kill herself and her baby. Doyle alerts the cops who sic a DA on the woman. Kerry and Mark call Doyle on this behavior, as it's not their responsibility as doctors to bring legal action onto people for drug and alcohol problems. Doyle stands firm on her convictions, and says she'll testify on her own time.

## Notes

* Doyle's cousin is a cop.

## Quotes

**Maggie:** How about this? If I get to testify against the bitch, I'll do it on my own time.\
**Doug:** I think we're gonna like her.
