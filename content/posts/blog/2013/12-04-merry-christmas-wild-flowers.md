<img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-6117" alt="Merry Christmas / Happy 16" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/12/tvguide2004-02.jpg" width="326" height="380" /> CBS will be running a repeat of _CSI_ on the 25th... <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Wild_Flowers">Wild Flowers</a>.

It's an interesting choice (I always wonder why they don't pick a really old episode), and makes me wonder if there's going to be carry over into what we see after the winter break. There's no new CSI this week, and the December 11th episode is sans Sara, so we're pretty much done with CSI for the year here at JFO. (Yes, Jorja will be in "Keep Calm and Carry-On" but I don't know when that will air.)

Speaking of that... 1996 to 2013? 17ish years of JFO. Next year, it'll be able to vote. I can't believe I'm still doing this, to this degree. I do still enjoy it greatly! My coworker, who is a CSI fan, has been helping out a lot on the back end (she did the redesign and has been fixing code/speeding things up), as well as posting when I'm offline. No idea how long that'll last, but it's really helpful.

Where are we going next? Well as long as CSI is CSIing along, I'll be here, JFOing along. I'm holding out hope that maybe I'll get to visit the CSI set, though I understand they're pretty restricted in so far as shows go.

Sometime early next month I'll pass along my funny stats/review of everything. Who wants to bet that Forget Me Not caused the most views on the site...? No one? Right. You guys have a great holiday! Tonight's the last night of Hanukkah, and my best present was a SkillSaw. Don't judge me!
