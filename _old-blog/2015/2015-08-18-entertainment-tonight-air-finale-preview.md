But, before the preview, here's a flashback for you.

Jorja mentions how she thought "Oh, a show about death on a Friday night?" and how terrible the show would do.

> ET was with the stars of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as they prepared for their emotional goodbye to the long-running CBS show, and we brought along footage from the early years for the cast members to reminisce about.

As Jorja said, "Four more days of shooting. Then we're done."

I'm sad to see you go, CSI. You will be missed.
