I know a lot of people aren't happy about "CSIs in peril" but I don't really stress over that sort of thing. Do I get a lot of Sara? Does she get cool scenes? I'm totally happy.

Most of the <a title="“Girls Gone Wild” Promo Pictures" href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/girls-gone-wild-promo-pictures/">press photos</a> we saw were from _before_ the shooting.

Me? I want Sara's shoes! They look so kicky and the colors are nice. I like shoes with colors like that, though.
