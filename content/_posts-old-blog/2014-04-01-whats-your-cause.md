Back in February, <a title="Artists and Athletes PSA Shoot" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/artists-and-athletes-psa-shoot/">Jorja and Marg joined A&amp;A to film "What's Your Cause"</a>

Here's the video:

<blockquote>The Artists &amp; Athletes Alliance recently gathered a number of our advisory board members as participants in a new campaign we are calling the "What's Your Cause? Campaign." We filmed public service announcements (PSAs) highlighting our members' favorite causes, charities and foundations.

The purpose of our campaign is to showcase a variety of important organizations that occupy the non-profit space and encourage all people to get get involved and support a cause that interests them.</blockquote>
If you want to donate to Jorja's cause, I'm running a <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jorjafox46/">Birthday Fundraiser for the ADI</a>. Please toss a couple bucks in if you can.

So. What's <em>your</em> cause?
