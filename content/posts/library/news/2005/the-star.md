Although [Emily Proctor] was having a great time on *The West Wing*, the lure of being a regular cast member in *CSI: Miami* was hard to resist. She consulted with her friend, former West Wing cast mate Jorja Fox (who plays Sara Sidle in *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*), before accepting the part.

"Jorja and I have been friends for years since we did a movie together (called *Forever Fabulous*)," she reveals in a charming Southern accent. "She was the first call I made when I was thinking about doing *CSI*. I call her Horha. And I said: 'Horha, am I going to do *CSI*? She said: 'I think you will like it.'
