**BEST IN SHOWS:**

After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

**READ THIS BACKWARDS AND IT'LL MAKE MORE SENSE:**

Jorja had a role in the indie-film sensation Memento.

**OUR WEIRD-RADAR WAS IMPOUNDED:**

"I might have that weird-radar, because the people who talk to me are almost never creepy. You've gotta wonder what kind of vibe you're putting out there if you're having really creepy people come talk to you."

**HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ONES THAT SLIP THROUGH:**

"If I have a drink in my hand, sometimes it accidentally falls in the direction of the person. I haven't gone home with anybody who tried to pick me up in a long time."

**WE FORGOT TO ASK:**

"You're not going to ask me what my favorite dildo is or something?"

"I think 'Make love, not war' might be the most profound statement that's ever been made. If people were spending more time having sex, they'd be a lot less inclined to be violent."
