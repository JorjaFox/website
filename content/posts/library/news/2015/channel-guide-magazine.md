At some point in the episode, another woman blows herself up, this time, it's a Lady Heather doppleganger outside of the mistresses' house. When the lookalike's car explodes, Brass catches on fire, but once he's extinguished by a fast-acting Sara, he stands there like a total bad-ass, proving once again that the former captain's cajones are made of ... well, brass.

Gil's in Vegas, sees his ex-wife Sara (#Awkward), and runs into a chipper redhead who flummoxes him to no end. Gil acts like an old, confused man.

Lady Heather is older, and I still want to slap her smug mug SOoooo hard, which is a testament to the sexy, complex and challenging character that actress Melinda Clarke has played intermittently throughout the series.

Sara still hates Lady Heather. Me too. I'm totally #TeamSara.

Sara and Gil are divorced, but Sara still loves the bug-loving lug. And finally, we get to see Gil talk to some bugs, because it's just not a Gil-centric episode if we don't' get to see him 1) Talk to bugs, 2) use the Latin name for a bug, 3) turn his head quizzically and look at something/ someone. Ding! Ding! Ding! Three for three! Bonus: Gil got to wear lots of goofy looking-hats in this episode. And, he seemingly trained bees in a matter of minutes, like the bug-whisperer he's always been.

The bees tell Gil where the murder is (in a scary, yet technologically awesome, shack!). Lo and behold! It's the Green Mile guy. Called it. He's got a bomb vest, and he's set up a bunch of bombs in a Las Vegas parking structure; requiring Catherine, Greg and Morgan to do some fancy wire-cutting. And even though she's been on the show since Season 11, when she was in a L.A/Las Vegas crossover episode, Morgan's hands still have the shakes. Once they're not dead, Morgan and Greg hug and I hope for a moment that they'll make out, because when has Greg ever gotten any action? He's always been in friend zone.

Gil convinces the mad bomber/ murderer not to blow himself up, because he deduces that the bomb vest isn't even activated. Murder man hates Gil because he blames Gil for Lady Heather leaving her role as a dom, and then stopping the boning her therapy patients, and then stopping her psychiatry practice altogether. Guy really loves his Lady Heather time. Gil tells a story about a whale whose mate can't hear his song, which makes no sense even though I think it's supposed to be about the man's unrequited love for LH, but is sad, nonetheless.

Catherine wants out of the FBI and wants to gank the Director's job that Sara wants. What mom doesn't want to be her daughter's boss?

Gil wraps everything up with Lady Heather (I don't care if she's a doctor, she'll always be a dominatrix to me) and he thanks her for making able to love someone like Sara. It's sweet, but he's also giving her some police procedural info, which makes me scratch my head: Why are they letting the consultant run the case?

But Sara gets the director's position, and even takes photos with her new badge so that'll be #Awkward due to Catherine's conversation of about 20 seconds ago.

And for a few seconds, you think that the Sara and Gil ship has sailed, but with a gentle nudge from newbie Lindsay, Sara watches Lady Heather's statement interview with Gil where he admits his love for Miss Sidle. Suddenly, Sara arrives at Gil's San Diego boat dock in a taxi, because clearly Sara's rather call a cab than ask her longtime pak Nick Stokes for a ride. (Another missed chance for George Eads to do something in this ep.). Gil is wearing yet-another hat, this time it's one that he stole from Ernest Hemmingway. Sarah boards Gil's ship and when they embrace, you know that it'll be Gil + Sara forever. While they sail away from San Diego, I can't help wonder why Sara brought only her small messenger bag with her, and I hope they didn't run that picture of her shaking hands with the commish in the newspaper because she's gone. I guess Catherine gets the job as CSI director by default. Because really, with Sara gone, it's the inmates running the asylum with Morgan, Greg and Hodges (and now newbie Lindsay) left in the department.
