Another exclusive peek into tonight's CSI, this time from (CBS owned) TV Guide.
<blockquote>Nothing seems to be going right for Julie Finlay on <em>CSI</em>.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/bad-day-finn/131127elisabeth-shue1/" rel="attachment wp-att-9445"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9445" alt="131127elisabeth-shue1" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/11/131127elisabeth-shue1-300x206.jpg" width="300" height="206" /></a>Although Finn (Elisabeth Shue), Sara (Jorja Fox) and Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) are <em>supposed </em>to be enjoying a spa weekend, it's clear in the exclusive sneak peek below from Wednesday's episode (10/9c, CBS) that something has gone terribly awry. Not only is Finn alone in the middle of nowhere, but she's sporting a pretty ugly bloody nose as well.

Unfortunately, things only get worse from there. Watch the video below to see what happens when Finn tries to flag down a passing car for help. (Hint: The driver isn't very helpful.) In fact, he or she is downright deadly? WTF is going on!?</blockquote>
