<blockquote><strong>TVGuide.com: Since Petersen remains an executive producer, did he come in and watch the filming? Did he seem like he was itching to get back in front of the camera?</strong>
<strong>Friedkin:</strong> He came down for two or three days, yeah. [...]

I think he'll do a few [more episodes] as he said he would. I think if they can craft some special stories for him... I think Jorja [Fox] will as well. [...]</blockquote>
