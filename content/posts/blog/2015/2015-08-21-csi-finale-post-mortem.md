At about 2am, the gang got together for one more dinner:

Jorja looks beat! Which is probably why she didn't surface on Twitter until around noon.

But the show is official done filming.

It's a weird feeling, being done. So far we know there's a scene with boats and Grissom, Sara is running the case, there are bombs, casinos, Lady Heather, and a charred body. This looks to be a classic episode of CSI!

Now we just wait a month.
