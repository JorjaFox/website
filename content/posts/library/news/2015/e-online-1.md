Full disclosure: I haven't watched "CSI" in years, but that didn't mean tonight wasn't a total emotional roller coaster for me.

I watched every single episode for the first nine seasons at least, and even stuck around for a couple more after Grissom left (and broke my heart in the process).

[...]

I loved CSI, and I never really stopped loving it. I just kind of grew up and apart from the show, just as the original characters grew apart from each other (looking at you, Grissom and Sara).

So, tonight's two-hour finale, which reunited Gil Grissom ("'William Petersen"'), Sara Sidle ("'Jorja Fox"'), Catherine Willows ("'Marg Helgenberger"'), Jim Brass ("'Paul Guilfoyle"'), David Hodges ("Wallace Langham"), the aforementioned Greg, and even Grissom's ridiculous dominatrix friend/foe Lady Heather ("'Melinda Clarke"'), felt like a trip back to my teen years in a way I should have expected but totally didn't.

It was like no time had passed at all, both for me and for the show. In fact, I'm pretty sure I have social studies homework due tomorrow, and that I should go to bed (as soon as I'm finished updating my LiveJournal with all my Grissom/Sara thoughts).

[...]

The emotional through-line of the finale was obviously Sara and Grissom reuniting since getting divorced however long ago that was. They both ended up admitting separately to Lady Heather that they were still in love with each other, but it took Lindsey hinting to Sara that she should watch Grissom's interrogation of Lady Heather for her to get that. In the end, she and Grissom sailed off into the sunset on his little boat, which is just as things should be.

[...]

From a fan standpoint, I loved everything about everything that I just saw.

If I'm looking at the episode with a more critical eye, that was totally and completely ridiculous. Obviously, the bomber was Doug Hutchison. Obviously, Sara and Grissom were destined to be together again. Obviously, all bombs (and there were a lot of bombs) that endangered anyone we cared about were diffused at the very last second. Obviously, bees.
