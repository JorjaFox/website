## Synopsis

Grissom and Warrick work a case of an old woman found mummified in her closet. Sara and Nick arrive to investigate a breaking and entering, only to find a raped teen. These cases are not as disparate as they first seem. Catherine looks into a gun found by a boy. The gun is connected to a week old murder across town that Warrick caught.

## Review

Sara works the second break-in, and is affected when she discovers that the daughter has been raped. She's upset when she later discovers that the daughter was raped by more than one person during the home invasion. Later when the daughter -- against her father's wishes -- comes in for a line up, Sara sits with her, very supportive. She gets frustrated and more upset when they discover that they can't pin the crime on either suspect. In the end, Sara takes it hard when the girl is found murdered in her parent's driveway. She and Grissom share a look, then Grissom processes the scene while Sara sits alone in the truck and cries.

## Notes

* Sara takes the rape case personally, being very supportive to the victim. She ends up sitting alone in the truck, crying, when the girl is murdered.
