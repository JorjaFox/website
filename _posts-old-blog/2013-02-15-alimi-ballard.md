Alimi Ballard plays Detective Crawford (formerly Officer Crawford), seen recently in "Strip Maul." He was back in "Exile" and will be working the case involving Sara Sidle in "Forget Me Not."

In a recent interview with CSI Files, Ballard confesses that his wife thinks he looks much in a suit (I agree), how well he gets along with Nick, and what it was like working with Jorja.

Yeah, I knew what you were interested in.
<blockquote>**CSI Files**: With Captain Brass (**Paul Guilfoyle**) not in “Forget Me Not,” you find yourself as the detective on a case that involves Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**). Since the two characters don’t have a deep connection and long understanding of each other at this point in the series, unlike Brass and Sara, is there some conflict between the two of you? Sara does find herself in some serious trouble in the installment.

**Ballard**: The scenes I filmed with Sara in “Forget Me Not” are some of my favorites, Shane. There’s nothing like some good old fashion TENSION to get the grease poppin’. I cannot wait to see how they put it all together.</blockquote>
Can't wait to see the tension on screen! You can read the whole interview on <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/02/interview-alimi-ballard/">CSI Files - Interview: Alimi Ballard</a>.
