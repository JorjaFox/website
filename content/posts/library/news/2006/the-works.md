One of the stars of the US's top-rated drama **CSI** speaks out...

AS SARA SIDLE, one of the crack forensics experts in **CSI: Crime Scene Investigation**, Jorja Fox gets to wade through human body parts to solve murders. The show has two spin-off series, and is set to return for its seventh year in the US in September.

**Did you think the show would become such a huge hit?**

When I read the script for **CSI**, it was like a trance I fell under. I became completely mesmerized by the idea of it but I didn't think it was going to be successful. It was about death and Americans are kind of weird about death. But I thought it was so interesting because it was a secret world that people hadn't got the chance to see very well. The bad thing about it, I think, is a lot of people expect their stolen wallets and stuff to be found in about 42 minutes and they get really irritated with the police when they don't.

**You were in the bizzare position of being sacked and then suddenly rehired two season ago...**

When i was fired for a few hours I thought it was kind of a joke but after I had been fired for about four or five days, I started accepting that maybe I really had been fired. Then I was invited back. I think I feel a little bit less safe about anything to do with that show but that's probably a good thing because change is inevitable. It left a strange situation in which half the cast was working with a raise and half the cast was not. And that's not necessarily good for anybody.

**Billy Petersen has spoken out against the "CSI" spin offs, what do you think?**

I would have wished that there weren't any spin offs of **CSI**. But I think that all the shows have been able to sort of find their own legs. Emily Proctor from **CSI: Miami** is a friend of mind so I was really happy for her. She was on **The West Wing** at the same time as me so she did call me before she took the role and said, "What do you think?".

**You're from New York, how well do you think "CSI: New York" is portraying the city?**

I think that they're doing a beautiful job showing the city. I think visually the show is stunning and there's sort of a blue dark grayness that I think is very appropriate for New York. Since 9/11 New York's economy has been struggling so I'm glad they chose to set it there, I'm all for bringing business to New York.

**Would you continue with "CSI"?**

I love my job. I've finished my tenth consecutive year on network television in the States and that's a really, really good run for anybody. I have dreams but I'll stay with the show and even if it goes away I've been very lucky.

**Do the special effects make you squeamish at all?**

I think the special effects guys try to gross me out. There was one scene this year where Greg and Sara found liquefied bodies in a car and he gets a gob of one of them on his face. I had to go out of the room.

**Do you think Sara and Grissom will ever get together?**

Their storyline is not over, it will get revisited. Because I'm a romantic at heart I would like to see something.
