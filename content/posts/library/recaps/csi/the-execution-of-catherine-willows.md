## Synopsis

A triple murder case from Catherine's rookie year is the focus of this intriguing installment. Fifteen years ago, Catherine helped put John Mathers on death row for the rape and murder of a coed at a nearby college. Her body was dumped in a trash bag, and two other girls found the same way were also linked to the suspect. As the episode opens, Mathers is about to be executed when he's granted a stay based on new DNA evidence. But while Catherine awaits the results of tests on hair samples found on the first victim, another girl at the same school is murdered...and discarded just like the first three--meaning the wrong man could be behind bars. Meanwhile, Brass, Sara and Grissom investigate a missing person's report on a teenage girl.

## Review

Sara doesn't have much in this. When a guy is found with a bloody shirt and his teenage daughter is missing, Sara gets to process him. She's fairly blas√© at first about the missing girl, figuring that she ran away from her drunken father. Later she discovers that her case is the same as Catherine's case, and that their missing girl is another victim of the WLVU 'Blue Paint' killer. She goes over the campus crime scene with Warrick, Catherine and Grissom, and takes the railing back to the lab.

## Notes

* Once again Sara shows her mechanical strengths, going over Debbie Restons' car with Warrick.
* Sara seems to understand ugly family situations.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Great. We're looking for a guy with 20/80 vision who drives a Chevy with a black interior.
