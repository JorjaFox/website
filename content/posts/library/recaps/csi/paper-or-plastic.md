## Synopsis

A robbery at a grocery store results in a shootout leaving five dead. The police officer at the scene believes Grissom has a grudge against him. The entire team has to process the enormous amount of evidence at the scene.

## Review

Grissom appears to be avoiding Sara at the crime scene, a result of the events in "Butterflied".

_Note: this episode was originally scheduled to air the week after "Butterflied" aired, explaining why Grissom is uncomfortable working with Sara._
