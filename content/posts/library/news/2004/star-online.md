Glamour mixes with relaxed attitudes as stars enter the Shrine
Auditorium

"CSI" star Jorja Fox gave a lot of thought to
preparing for the Emmy Awards' red carpet, but that did not save her
from some minor embarrassment.

"I told my stylist I had to wear pink. I brought out 13 dresses,"

Fox said in an interview Sunday just a few yards from the doors of the
Shrine Auditorium.

"It took me one-and-one-half hours to get ready and 15 minutes to
put on my dress," she said.

Then she opened her purse to show the products she brought to
continue to look glamorous on a windy and cooler-than-usual Emmy day.

All that work, all that preparation, but not everything went
according to plan.

"What's the most embarrassing thing that happened to me? In the last
hour?" she said.

Fox said she went to an E! Channel interview and accidentally
interrupted the hosts trying to introduce her on live television.

Fox, who almost left "CSI" over a contract dispute but came back
after temporarily being fired, said her character, Sara Sidle, will
continue to be in trouble. "Sara lives in a rabbit hole. It's been like
a roller-coaster ride," she said about the plot line.
