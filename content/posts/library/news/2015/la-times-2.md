Jorja Fox, one of the show's original cast members, has said in previous interviews that she didn't think anyone would watch the series when it first premiered in 2000. She could not have been more wrong. The drama about a forensics investigation division in Las Vegas was an instant smash.

During its 15-year run, "CSI" spawned three spinoffs and became one of TV's most popular series, in the U.S. and internationally.

Like other cast member, Fox, who played investigator Sara Sidle, was extremely appreciative that the show was given a final bow: "It was such a great gift. I was thrilled. And the finale was truly a love letter to our fans."

Fox added that working again with William Petersen, who played investigator Gil Grissom, and Marg Helgenberger, who played Catherine Willows, was exciting. "Us all being back together felt like the most natural thing in the world. It was such a joy to have them."

One of the main attractions for fans of the series was the romance between Grissom and Sidle. And the finale featured them in a tough situation. After getting married years ago, things started to go wrong and they divorced.

A fatal explosion in a casino brings the retired Grissom back to Vegas, where he has a tense reunion with his ex.

"My character is really thinking, 'How can I work with him again?' and it's pretty awkward," Fox said. "It's uncomfortable and messy."

However, by the end of the episode, the two discover that they are still in love with each other.

Said Fox: "I always knew I was part of this weird love story. For all the violence and darkness in the show, there's still this love story, and that's such a terrific way to end up. No matter how black things seem, 'CSI' is a love story; there is long and lasting love."

The couple is seen at the end literally riding off into the sunset, where Grissom has relocated. But there's still the matter of Sidle's job in Las Vegas, where she's been promoted to the head of the CSI unit. The future of Grissom and Sidle is still a mystery as the credits close.

"On one hand, maybe they'll just ride around in the boat for an hour and then call it quits," Fox said with a chuckle. "Or maybe they'll stay together and become CSIs for the ocean and the environment. There's no talk of a spinoff, but that would make a great idea for a show."

In the meantime, Fox is looking forward to the next chapter of her life and career.

"I have no idea what's next," Fox said. "In some ways, the end of the show caught me by surprise. It's the first time in 19 years I've been between jobs. I'm just going to decompress a little bit. It's been nice just hanging out with my dog and just letting go. I can't wait to see what the next thing is."
