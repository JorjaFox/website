A new, New York-focused "CSI" is due on CBS this fall, but the "CSI" making headlines last week is the original, Las Vegas version.

Two popular regulars, George Eads and Jorja Fox, prominent since the beginning, were dismissed when they sought salary increases and declined to report for work.

The man who said, "You're fired," Leslie Moonves, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Viacom, CBS' parent, was blunt Sunday.

"We feel it's very important that it's time people realize that a contract is a contract," he said. "We already renegotiated with these people once, after the second year of the show. What also hasn't been reported, we did offer them a raise even though we didn't have to. When somebody doesn't show up for work, that says to us that, OK, they don't want to work for us anymore. And that's our attitude." Moonves said recasting the two roles in now underway. "CSI" creator Anthony Zuiker, on hand to discuss the new spinoff, said he was "saddened by the news" of a "business decision" that was CBS', not his, to make.

At his news conference, Moonves was also asked about the possibility that the FCC may fine the network and its owned stations for singer Janet Jackson's notorious "wardrobe malfunction" at this year's Super Bowl. He said it was "patently ridiculous" to blame CBS for an incident over which it had no control and that the network would fight any fine levied.
