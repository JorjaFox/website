Props to JFO regular, Lanos, for spotting this!

When Jorja was at the <a title="Show Shelter Pets Some Love" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/show-shelter-pets-some-love/">HSUS (Humane Society US) event for ShelterPet</a>, Kathy Patalski was also there to promote her book, 365 Vegan Smoothies. Jorja picked up a copy of the book.

I loveÂ smoothies. They're my on-the-road treat when I travel for work.
