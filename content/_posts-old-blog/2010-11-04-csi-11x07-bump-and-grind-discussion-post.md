Rock, paper and yuck!  Speculate and spoil yourselves away. I'll update the post later tonight, once I have screencaps etc. They should all be up by midnight Eastern time.

<h3>Recap</h3>
<del><em>Coming Soon!</em></del>

An impressive episode. A lot of Sara. A lot of SMART Sara.  Like solving cases and being a general CSI badass. Not to mention we got a hint of GSR, a mention of Grissom, and Sara showing she's grown and changed from "Dead Doll."  That gives this episode a total of Four Stars.  I'm going to vid clip the baseball scene and the Ray scene tomorrow.  Folks, this one was good.  Just fast forward through that opening bit with the cooking and eating of credit cards and ears.  Could've done without that.
