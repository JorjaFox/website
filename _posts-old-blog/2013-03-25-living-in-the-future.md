There are some new features on the site, as part of my ongoing modernization effort, and I want to start by warning you: If you're using **IE 8**, you may be left out in the cold. This isn't because I don't like IE, but much for the same reason I dropped trying to support IE 6 and make it look nice, the effort it takes to make a site look good in IE 8 is becoming monumental. When IE 10, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, all look great out of the box, I'll spend the time to make it work on IE 9 but not IE 8. For a reference, Google doesn't support IE 8 lower anymore either. Upgrade to IE 9 if you can, or install Chrome or Firefox (or Safari) if not.
<h3>Better Images!</h3>

If you see a box with a red X, then you're on an older browser and you should upgrade as soon as you can. Thankfully I've written the code to fall back to the old version if you're on an older browser.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-6440" alt="Identicons" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/200px-Identicon.svg_.png" width="60" height="60" />Avatars right now default to '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon">Identicons</a>' which are those fully geometric icons you see that represent ... you. And if you see me, you'll see a geektastic picture of me as a child. So how do you get your own special one? Sign up at <a href="https://gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> with the same email you use here, upload a picture, and sites all over the net will magically use it. If you already have a Gravatar account, you can add multiple email addresses, and assign a different avatar to each one. The reason for all these changes was to make JFO 'Retina Ready.' I have to tell you, JFO looks damn fine. I've upgraded the header images and everything else to look good on both, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
<h3>New Features</h3>
First up, videos. Given the nightmares with trying to get videos uploaded elsewhere in a timely, regionless, fashion (for you guys outside the US), _some_ videos will be hosted here on JFO for you. I did this for the "Forget Me Not" videos, and anything major like that I'll try to keep doing going forward. These videos should degrade nicely for you, with a link if you can't see anything. The videos are totally downloadable, but please do me the favor of not reposting all over the place. Just link back here, I'd greatly appreciate it.

More social things have been added, including the ability to 'like' posts. This only works if you're logged in to <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> however, much like Facebook like only works if you're logged in to <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. I removed the comment form that let you comment with your Facebook, Twitter, or WordPress.com credentials after people complained they couldn't see the smilies, and the replies weren't working right. I'm actually in direct contact to the people who wrote that comment tool, and they're aware (and in agreement) about some of the technical annoyances with it.
<h3>Server Stuff</h3>
The server was upgraded to more memory in January, after I'd had it up to here with the hangs and crashes. There were a couple slowdowns on the Wednesday of "Forget Me Not," but the site never crashed, so I think we did good! I was asked about traffic, and which day had the most. "Forget Me Not" wins. By a surprisingly small final count, the difference was 268 visitors (Thursday had 65 _more_ people than Wednesday). The "Two Mrs Grissoms" wasn't even close, and was lower than "Exile." Stats are really funny to look at and measure. You'd think it would be easy to look at numbers and go 'Aha!' but it's not. But that's a totally separate geeky thing.
<h3>The You Guys Stuff</h3>
I don't say this often, and I know I go through months where I get grumpy about all the crazy that goes on. You guys have been amazing. Everyone is being polite, respectful, and friendly, even when disagreeing. You're all supportive, no matter if someone is pro-GSR or not, and you're being one of the most awesome fandoms I've been involved in. Seriously, I've been doing this fan stuff since I was a little kid, and this is the first time I've not had to cool down any infighting. There was a small kerfluffle the morning of the episode, but that was taken care of as best it can be, and everyone seems to be ... cool.

So you guys? Rock. Thank you for being so cool, and thank you for not giving up on me, Jorja, or JFO.
