**CSI: Crime Scene Investigation** star **Jorja Fox** fears she'll upset the hit forensics drama's producers after agreeing to pose for a new pro-vegetarian advertisement that borrows heavily from the show. Fox initially thought she didn't need her bosses' permission to take part in the People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals 'Investigate Vegetarianism' ad but has started to worry.

In the ad, Fox appears in a dimly-lit alleyway, which is cordoned off by police tape. The actress, a longtime vegetarian, says, "I didn't see that there was anything controversial, or even confrontational, about it. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble."

Meanwhile, Fox is celebrating after learning CSI co-star William Petersen has just dropped meat from his diet. She adds, "He's testing it, but he's really enjoying it."
