## Synopsis

A reverend is found dead on Warrick's gravestone, sending the CSIs into turmoil as they investigate the life of Warrick's widow, Tina. Tina's life has gone downhill. After Warrick's death, she quit her job as a nurse and now lives with Eli in Warrick's old house. The reverend, who was none too clean himself, was killed by the local crime boss in a convoluted punishment for his son's life of non-crime.

## Review

Sara and Finn go to Tina's house, which was Warrick's, to investigate as the reverend was there the night before. Tina doesn't want them to come in, trying to hide evidence of her drug using boyfriend. At Sara's behest, after Eli is taken away by child services, Tina starts to clean her act up.

## Notes

* Before leaving Vegas, Sara brought food by for Tina, but no one answered the door.

## Quotes

**Sara:** The reverend's bank-accounts are being fruitful and multiplying.
