Thanks to Shane, we already knew this would be a good episode. I give it four Sara Stars. Sara was stretched thin, and you could see her nerves fraying. The CSI team has gone through too much personal drama like that. Of course, the end with her arguing with Nick about quitting and how you have to mean it was pretty much the conversation I had with a friend about the same thing!

Do you have any favorite quotes?

There's no CSI next week. The next episode is on the 10th of October.
