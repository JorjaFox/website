<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/galapagos.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3482" title="galapagos" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/galapagos-224x140.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="75" /></a>Back in February, Jorja went to the Galapagos to check out the Galapagos National Park offices (PNG) and see what sort of conservation work went on there.  The article is in Spanish, and mine is pretty bad, so a lot of the translation comes from Google Translate.
<blockquote>Princes and famous scientists, from the stars of film and television, politicians and socialites, few are reluctant to know the land of 'Lonesome George'. "He is more famous than I am," joked actress Jorja Fox, famous for CSI: Las Vegas, during her visit  in February.</blockquote>
