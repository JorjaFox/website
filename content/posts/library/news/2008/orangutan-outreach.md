**Public Service Announcements (PSAs)**

We spent a few days this past January in sunny California filming our first set of Public Service Announcements (PSAs). We would like to personally thank the stars, Tatjana Patitz and Jorja Fox, who graciously volunteered their time and talents to our cause, as well as Jim Denault for offering to film the PSAs. We'd also like to thank Hayley Moss, without whom it never would have happened. We were able to gather a nearly all-volunteer crew on very short notice as well as borrow some top quality gear. And when we did have to pay, most of the vendors were very sympathetic to our cause and gave us incredibly generous discounts.

The PSAs are in the final stage of post-production. Once they are edited and ready to go, we will be debuting them online. They will be available on our website and YouTube - as well as our [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18449414264&utm_source=Spring2008Newsletter&utm_medium=MailChimp Facebook] and [http://www.myspace.com/orangutanoutreach?utm_source=Spring2008Newsletter&utm_medium=MailChimp MySpace] pages. We are also hoping to air them on Animal Planet and at any media outlet that will play them.
