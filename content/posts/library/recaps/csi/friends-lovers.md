## Synopsis

Grissom and Warrick investigate a case of an apparently terrorized teen found dead in the desert; Sara examines the circumstances surrounding the body of a woman who was buried the week before and is found in a garbage dumpster; Nick and Catherine look into the claim by a teacher that she killed the dean of the school in self-defense.

## Review

Sara investigates a dumped body in Henderson, dumpster dives and realizes the corpse has been embalmed. When David Phillips (Assistant Coroner) stumblingly hits on her while she's checking the database, she gives him some tips for 'pulling chicks', including giving him a 'C for cute'. Sara discovers the corpse was buried a week ago; and excavates the grave only to find no casket in the grave (ruling out the funeral director's claim of grave robbing). Sara checks out caskets for sale at the funeral home and discovers they've been re-used. Sara confronts the mortuary director.

## Notes

* Sara wants to be cremated when she dies rather than be buried with the worms.
* Sara is apparently comfortable with guys hitting on her -- or at least comfortable with David Phillips hitting on her.
* Sara appreciates the gentlemanly gestures shown by the detective at the scene.
* Sara imposes her own sentence on the mortuary owner, telling him how he's going to make restitutions before she even talks to the D.A.

## Quotes

**Grissom:** Sara, body of your own. Dumpster out near Henderson.\
**Sara:** Oh, I'll dress down.

**Phillips:** I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.\
**Sara:** Are you hitting on me, David? _(David nods, shyly_ _Sidle laughs softly)_ Let me give you some advice. If you want to pull chicks, you've gotta get aggressive. Lose the glasses, lose the coat, grow some scruff. _(thoughtful pause)_ You do get a C for cute, though.

**Sara:** You sell caskets, right? As part of your mortuary service? I want to see some.\
**Mortician** I can arrange a viewing.\
**Sara:** Bonus.

**Sara:** There's no way I'm going to end up in a dumpster, wrapped in plastic. I'm gonna be cremated. Dust in the wind, you know. I don't want any part of these things [re. caskets].

**Mortician** I see the world in a totally different perspective from most people.\
**Sara:** Yeah, I know. You see dead people. So do I. And when they turn up in dumpsters, I like to see they get back where they belong.
