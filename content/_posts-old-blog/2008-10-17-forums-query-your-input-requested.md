<em>Whoops! People can comment again! Heh. My bad.</em>

Okay, so now that the videos are done, I'm looking at the forums.  I got the code pretty much where I want it (it's bbPress, which integrates with WordPress <b>and</b> is small and speedy).

I've sketched it out with three 'areas' to the foums:

<b>Jorja Fox</b> - About Jorja. Duh ;) If it's about Jorja's acting or advocacy or producing, it goes here.
<b>JFO</b> - About here. This is for things like tech questions, suggestions and so on.
<b>Community</b> - About you guys! It'd be a cross between a kitchen sink (anything goes) and a place for you to post about fan things.

Is there something I'm missing? Things that need to be better explained? Give a shout here!
