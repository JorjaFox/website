Back in October, Jorja was at a screening for the movie <a href="http://thisissanctuary.com">Sanctuary</a>, about the lives of our primate brothers and sisters.
<blockquote>Through first-hand accounts and rescues, to interventions and interactions with the primates themselves, SANCTUARY shows you a wondrous world where humans have given everything to save the lives of these used, abused, unwanted, and abandoned animals and given them a second chance. Narrated by Victoria Summer, this is a story of innocent lives interrupted by tragedy, but inspired by heroes and hope. Meet Puchi, Chucky, Jimmy Sr., Chaac &amp; Bali—each of their stories touches us in a different way.</blockquote>
She was also interviewed (briefly) by Jane Velez-Mitchell:

Thank you, Jorja, for never failing to be a light for humanity.
