I was in Mississippi for a week, camping in the woods with 5000 people.  And guess what? Nothing major happened in Jorja-Land!  That's a first, but it's probably because I actually had internet the whole time and just refused to use it.  It was nice to unplug and get back to nature for a while.

So what happened while I was gone?

The New York Times Sunday Crossword (often called the most difficult newspaper crossword puzzle ever) had Jorja Fox as an answer back on March 14th, and <a href="http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/book-binding/">Patrick Merrell</a> commented on it:
<blockquote>In that same area, JORJA FOX is a cool name, all the more so because itâ€™s gettable from the crossings.</blockquote>

Eric Szmanda (aka Greg Sanders) talked to <a href="http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/Eric+Szmanda+Talks+CSI-77738.html">Female First</a> (a UK magazine) and said a truth we all know:
<blockquote>And having Jorja Fox back has been awesome.</blockquote>

Gerald McCullouch (aka Bobby the Ballistics Guy, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/ItsAHardG">ItsAHardG</a>) and Dustin Lee Abrams (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/vegasoul">@vegasoul</a>) put up a couple candid pics with Jorja:

There are eight new episodes of CSI coming your way, and CBS put out a video promoting them. Spoilers exist. You've been warned.
