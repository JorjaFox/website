<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/07/tv-100x100.png" alt="tv" title="tv" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1928" /> Yes, JFO: TV is what you're thinking it is. Online, JFO hosted, not-restricted by nation, videos of Jorja Fox.  Found at <a href="http://tv.jorjafox.net">http://tv.jorjafox.net</a>, we have our own video repository. (The 'Video Gallery' link takes you there, too.)

The idea behind it is for videos that, for whatever reason, can't be done on youTube, or are preventing our overseas fans (and Canadians) from seeing the coolness of Jorja.  There won't be full episodes or even all the Jorja scenes from an episode posted.  Just one or two, perhaps, and promos and other things that are hard to find. Like I Love the 70s.

You won't be able to (easily) download these, and you won't be able to embed them on your site at all. I'm sure someone clever can download them, and I have no plans to stop you on that note. I do **ask** that you not reproduce these on YouTube if they're not already there. If this becomes a problem, I'll have to start watermarking the source vids.

There aren't a lot of videos, yet, but I'm slowly expanding them with select clips etc.  Again, you're not going to get whole episodes, folks, only that which can be used as promotional material to get you to purchase the video legally.
