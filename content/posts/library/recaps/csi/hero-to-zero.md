## Synopsis

A homeless man is harassed by some masked street thugs, only to be saved by a young man dressed as a superhero. Sara and Nick find the hero, beaten to death, but are able to identify the barefoot homeless man when he returns to try and get his cart, and learn that the assailants drove off in a red truck.

While looking for more evidence, Morgan Brody and Greg stumble across two more heroes. They ID the dead man as 'Dominion' (aka Brad Jeffries). Their number one suspect, Tony Agraro, had tangled with the three heroes before, but is found dead, and one of the heroes is the suspect. He's innocent, but the homeless man, Roger, is found with Brad's custom bat, claiming to be 'the real Batman.'

The killer turns out to be Seth, Brad's stepfather.

## Review

Sara makes sure the homeless man, Roger, is fed and clothed back at the station before talking to him.

## Notes

* Sara's escape as a child was science and math.

## Quotes

**Sara:** I guess I just don't get it. You know, my childhood ... the fantasy was never my escape. I lost myself in science and numbers. It's all I needed, I guess.
**Russell:** Well you liked things that were clear or proven. Right or wrong. Black or white.
**Sara:** Maybe.
