## Synopsis

The Gig Harbor Killer is back. Twin brothers Jared Brisco (the confessed killer) and Paul Winthrope (the free lawyer) both argue that Jared is innocent.

This time he calls 911 before he murders a woman, and like before, stages the crime scene. Sara and Nick are first on the scene and collect the evidence. Since D.B. Russell believes the initial killing was done by the brothers together, they now feel than the one un-jailed brother has a new partner. Working with DB, Sara suspects Jared's apparent insanity is not an act. After his time in foster care, Jared was susceptible to a stronger influence, especially one that reflected himself: i.e. his twin brother.

Up in Seattle, Finn works with a local PI (and ex-boyfriend) and investigate Jared and Paul's birth, subsequent abandonment at a church, and adoption. While Jared was adopted, Paul is listed as dying shortly after birth. The infant body at the church turns out to be a doll with a photo of the possible mother tucked inside, and a hair.

They're able to find the Gig Harbor Killer's lair, but at the cost of the life of his latest victim. When rescued, she attacks Greg and hits him with a pipe, taking his gun. Finn is forced to shoot and kill her to protect him. It turns out that the woman was a post-surgery transgendered man who was used by the Gig Harbor Killer, however the city exonerates Finn for killing what appears to be the Gig Harbor Killer.

## Review

Listening to the audio, Sara is able to identify two people walking, implying the killer has a partner. When Sara and DB listen to interviews with Jared Brisco, and he says how after foster care how could he be anything _but_ a serial killer, Sara is pained.

## Notes

* Sara is understanding of people in foster care.
* Sara checks on Greg after he's injured on the scene.

## Quotes

**Nick:** reading 'People Lie, Follow the Evidence'?
**Sara:** We're really good at that.

**Sara:** You did the best you could. You need to know that. In time, you will know that. As for how you live with what happened, I wish I knew the answer to that.
