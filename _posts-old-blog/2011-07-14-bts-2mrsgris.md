<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3656" title="Matthew Jaeger" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/07/jaeger-redux-210x140.png" alt="The Killer from The Two Mrs. Grissoms" width="100" height="75" />Massive thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewdjaeger">Matthew D. Jaeger</a> for his behind the scenes tweets last night about "The Two Mrs. Grissoms."  He missed my heads up about how Jorja's not on Twitter, but he had some awesome things to say about her and _CSI_.

Here's a quick list of the cool Jorja Facts you may not have known:
<blockquote>Yes, [Jorja] is that beautiful in real life - I would argue more so.  Admittedly, I have little crush...

[Jorja] was our welcome wagon (no one else shot on day 1) and was amazing. Made sure we were comfy and helped us ﬁnd the ﬂow of CSI.

While shooting this scene, [Jorja] got her sign name. She surfs, so itʼs “hang loose” sign with just the pinkie. (Shake ASL "j")

Jorja said she really liked this episode because she got to explore a lot of character work, in addition to all the science.

[Jorja] learned a ton of ASL in about a week for this episode, I was (and am) crazy impressed.

They tried to get shots of [Jorja] and I signing at the same time to show Sarah trying to sign and getting it wrong.</blockquote>
Many thanks!  I know I'll be remembering how to sign Jorja's sign-name!
