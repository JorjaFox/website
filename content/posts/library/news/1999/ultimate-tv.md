"ER" costar Jorja Fox has been cast as a lead on the new Tom Fontana/Barry Levinson series for UPN, according to Daily Variety. In "The True Story," Fox is slated to play a medical intern - basically the same role she currently has on TV's hottest drama.

**UPN** is funding a pilot and six scripts of "True Story," but will decide after the pilot is completed whether or not to commit to 13 episodes.

Before "ER," Fox played Sarah Bryant in the 1998 television special "How to Make the Cruelest Month." She has also starred in "Jerky Boys," "Tiara Tango" and "Feminist Warriors."
