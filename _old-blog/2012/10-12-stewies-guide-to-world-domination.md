Mad props to Stephanie Simons for finding out that Stewie Griffin digs Jorja!

There's a book, _Family Guy: Stewie's Guide to World Domination_, all about Stewie, by Stewie. He's a character on _Family Guy... _which I don't watch. I rarely watch sitcoms anymore so all I know is he's a talking baby who is evil and has a British accent. Here's the book description:
<blockquote>At first sight, the Griffens may seem like a normal blue collar family from Quonochontaug Rhode Island, but Peter (the family's loutish dad), Brian (the erudite, martini–swilling pet dog) and Stewie (the evil toddler son) set them apart from all others.

Now Stewie––a true baby genius and the most popular of the Griffen clan––speaks out. Having been hell bent on achieving world domination ever since he escaped the cursed ovarian Bastille he was incarcerated in for nine grueling months, he has finally decided that in order to rule the world we live in one must first understand it. Herewith are his musings on family, love, parenting, preschool, work, pop culture, politics and more. If only we knew then what Stewie knows now, adults everywhere could have defeated their mother's matriarchal tyranny and toppled the "gynocracy" she ruled over . . .and god knows what else!

This book is for the insufferable child in us all, eager to buck the ways of the old guard or just eager for a laugh.</blockquote>
What does this have to do with Jorja? Apparently she is 'Me-ow':
