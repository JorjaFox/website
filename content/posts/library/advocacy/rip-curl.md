While Rip Curl is primarily known for surfing equipment and events, their annual Malibu Pro contest has an ulterior motive. Their event is dedicated to the preservation of beaches. In Rip Curl hosted a female contest designed to promote the beauty, soul and excitement of not only women's surfing, but the beauty, soul and excitement of the sacred Chumash Indian site that we call Malibu.
