<h2>Review</h2>

Well, it's an episode that didn't make golf any more or less interesting to me, but there were a few, select, Sara scenes, and a tiny tidbit of Grissom.  So three stars (out of five) and an amusing hour.

<blockquote><strong>Sanders:</strong> Sometimes I wonder if you two are really married.
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Well ... Now that you mention it ... Just kidding!
<strong>Sanders:</strong> Hah. 6000 miles?
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>*grinning*</em> So far, so good.
