Alas, yours truly was trying to be 'smart' and integrate logins between the forum and blog (log in to one, and you're logged into the other) and borked the whole thing. If you're having problems logging in, you'll have to delete all cookies from jorjafox.net to fix it. Visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/">About Cookies</a> for directions for Macs and Windows. Unix folk tend to know how that works without help.
