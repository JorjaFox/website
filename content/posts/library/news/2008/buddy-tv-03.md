Jorja Fox left *CSI* last November, leaving fans with a promise that it wouldn&rsquo;t be the last time they would see her character Sara Sidle.&nbsp; For seven months now, the 39-year-old actress has savored the &ldquo;break from the commitment of a weekly television series.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although not yet ready to do a new television show, she&rsquo;s ready to hold up to the end of her bargain as she returns for the ninth season of *CSI*.

&rdquo;It will be so hard to follow up *CSI*," Fox told *TV Guide*. "No matter what I do, it's big shoes to fill. If I'm going to do TV, then my loyalty and my heart belong to *CSI*."

**Warning: May contain spoilers.**

It seems that Fox couldn&rsquo;t stay away for long.&nbsp; As reported previously, she&rsquo;ll be returning in the premiere episode of the new season, which is probably the last time viewers will see the entire cast of *CSI* together.

"When I left in October, it was so decisive-everybody got me a goodbye cake.&nbsp; It's a surprise for me to be back, especially this soon," Fox said.&nbsp; "The kindest thing that the writers did for Sara Sidle was to walk her out in one piece. I had an amazing, beautiful, honorable, dignified exit."

"When I heard I was returning, there were certain parts of last season that I felt Sara would be aware of," she added.&nbsp; "I watched as much [*CSI*] as I could.&rdquo;

In addition to the first episode of the new season, Fox&rsquo;s return will include the third episode, which she filmed during the last week of May.

"It involves an old friend of Sara's who has to confront a [life or] death situation with his wife," Fox explained.
