Mad props to poppie_lee of the JFO forums for posting this.

Spearheaded by <strong>daphne dangerlove</strong> and <strong>cabooklover</strong> of <a href="http://www.yourtaxdollarsatwork.org/">YTDaW</a> message boards, GSR fans raised money for <a href="http://www.nationalcasa.org/">CASA</a>, Court Appointed Special Advocates for Children.  Through their efforts, they raised $20,000 as a thank you to Jorja and William Petersen.  <del datetime="2008-11-26T19:34:39+00:00">They called their work 'Sending out GSR in Style'.</del> The total amount was raised from the "Dollars for Sense" (2007) and "Sending Out GSR In Style" campaigns, both run by daphne and cabooklover.  Also a portion of the funds were donated by Jorja Fox, Naren Shankar and Carol Mendelsohn.
