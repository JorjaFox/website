Grissom's last episodes are airing in the UK now, and <a href="http://whatsontv.co.uk/blogs/tvspy/various/in-the-latest-issue-of-tv-satellite-week-35/">TV & Satellite Week</a> snagged an interview with William Petersen.  Not much is different than the other articles we've read, but perhaps this will help lay to rest the whole Grissom/Sara/Heather triangle.

<blockquote>**Why has Sara been so important to him?** She is the heart of Grissom.  Jorja Fox and I have been slowly playing with the chemistry between them for years.<br /><br />**He's also had a real fascination with Lady Heather, hasn't he?** They have a very intricate relationship that comes with a great deal of respect.  But she has a lot of trouble, a lot of problems, and ultimately Grissom likes to stay away from problems.</blockquote>
