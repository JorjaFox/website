As a reminder, the summer fundraisers is, again, Surfrider!  Crowdrise is handling the money.  You just head over to the <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-bday2011">JFO Birthday 2011</a> page and press that nice big 'Donate' button on the side there.   **Donations will be open until September 10th, 2011**.

While I can't promise Jorja will see these, why not pass along your birthday wishes to her in the comments.

Oh and if you're on Twitter, use the hashtag **#HappyBirthdayJorjaFox** in your Tweets today.  Maybe we can make her a Trending Topic!
