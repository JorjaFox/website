"Los Angeles Confidential" magazine featured "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation**s Jorja Fox in the May issue, 'Gimmie Shelter' column.

Jorja talked about her ten-and-a-half-year-old Boxer Ali (yes, as in Muhammad Ali), a rescue dog from New York.

The article revealed Fox's soft spot for animals, her childhood dream to have a show on "Animal Planet" that hasn't gone away and her assistance with the "North Central Animal Shelter" last year.
