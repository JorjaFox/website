Brian Van Holt is in fine form here as Finn’s ex-husband, whom she crosses paths with while back in Seattle tracking a case that’s quite personal to her.

**Risky Business Class**

I traded tweets with Liv Devine and what I can say this is. If you come to JFO because you love Jorja's acting ability, watch this episode.

Everything I've heard makes me expect this is our five-stars-for-Sara episode. After all, Liz promised me.
