 :idea: <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/ ">Wordpress 2.5</a> has been installed. It's a change on the management end, so nothing should look too different for the users.  This also gave me a change to install a couple plugins to combat spam (which, as you'll note, has been pretty low since the return of the blog).

If you have suggestions for things you'd like to see on the Blog, post 'em here!
