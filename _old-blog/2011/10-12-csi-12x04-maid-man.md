Yet again, I will be late on this.  Sukkot starts tonight (it's an obligatory eat outside holiday, yeah, I have cool ones!) so I won't post screencaps or a recap till Saturday night/Sunday morning.
<h3>Official Release</h3>
The former Mayor of Las Vegas is shot at the Mob Museum and the CSIs embark on a history lesson in search of clues.

<h3>Recap</h3>
Coming 'soon'.  It's another week o' Jewish Holidays from sundown Wednesday to Saturday, so I won't be able to recap or screen cap till Saturday night or Sunday morning.  If one of you wants to fill in, I'd appreciate it.
