<p>For everyone who just went 🤨 please know I read the title and called over to my wife "Hey, I know what episode 4's about!"</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Long Pig” – The CSI team investigates when a body is dug up in the luau pit of a Hawaiian-themed hotel. Also, Internal Affairs begins to question Grissom and Sara’s return to the crime lab, on the CBS Original series CSI: VEGAS, Wednesday, Oct. 27 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+.</p></blockquote>

<p>While there are press photos, none have Jorja this week. Why? Either they let her off since Jorja's a vegetarian (as is Sara) <em>or</em> her part in the episode would involve heavy spoilers about the ongoing case.</p>

<p>For everyone still confused, "Long Pig" is slang for human meat, because humans taste like pig apparently.</p>

<p>It comes from the Marquesan phrase 'puaa oa', as a way to euphemistically refer to cannibalism. It was first reported to the Western World from the 1919 travelogue of French Polynesia "White Shadows in the South Seas".</p>
