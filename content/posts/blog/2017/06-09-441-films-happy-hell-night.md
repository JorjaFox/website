Remember that weird movie, _[Happy Hell Night](https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/happy-hell-night/)_? The one where Jorja was an uncredited sorority sister?

Well [441 Films](http://www.441films.com) is apparently working on extras for it. I can only presume they'll be reissuing it! I'd heard that it was [coming out on Blu-Ray](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Happy-Hell-Night-Blu-ray/177005/)Â (eta August, UK release only), but guess who they talked to about it?

Yep, Jorja.

It constantly amuses me that she's uncredited, but the DVD covers have her on it (and most mention her by name):

Yes, that dead person with a pick-axe through her head is, indeed, Ms. Jorja Fox!
