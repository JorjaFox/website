**Readers dish on why Jorja Fox's departure from 'CSI' should be celebrated**

In October, Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle on 'CSI' since the show premiered in 2000, told EW.com she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities "before (she) gets too old." We asked readers to weigh in on her departure, and while some fans were upset over the seemingly definite demise of GSR, others were practically jubilant.

"I can't wait for it to happen," wrote Bob from Lewiston, N.Y. "The pathetic character she played had no screen presence."

"YES! YES! YES!" exclaimed Michelle of Smithville, Tenn. "She is so overdramatic and whines so much about everything! They should have kept her dead when they had the chance. That would have been good TV and she would have left a martyr. Shows that kill off one of their main stars always have a revitalized audience."

[...]

I never really cared for Sara in the first place, so I have to say the show will be better. She's too hard to identify with and seems to have no personality whatsoever. Anybody who replaces her has got to be better. BTW, was that a baby bump I saw or just an ill-fitting shirt? **--Mary, Norton, Kan.**

I don't think it will be either worse or better, just different. I really got creeped out thinking about her relationship with Grissom, though, so I guess I'm glad she's gone. Usually when two of the characters hook up, the show goes down the tubes. Look at "moonlighting" for an example. With the "X-Files" it was partially the tension between Scully and Mulder that kept the show interesting; it was really getting weird toward the end. **--Sue, Brunswick, Md.**

Sara Sidle is a cold, bitter, toxic, unfriendly character who does not generate one sliver of empathy or familiarity with the viewer. I want her to go so that someone else (anyone else) can get a chance to connect with the viewers. Grissom needs to get it on with Lady Heather. **--Leona, Sarasota, Fla.**

I don't think that her departure will make a difference one way or the other. I like the idea of Grissom having a love interest, but I never felt he and Sara had any chemistry. Perhaps it's just Jorja Fox playing his love interest. I just don't buy it. **--Kerri**

While I have nothing against Jorja Fox, I strongly dislike her character and I am looking forward to her departure. I believe the show will be improved drastically because of her departure, because the writers will no longer try to cram 30 seconds of Grissom/Sara "romance" into the show when those 30 seconds could be used to make the episodes intelligent and thought-provoking. Because of the Grissom/Sara pairing, the show has been reduced to a mindless, teen soap opera. I'm looking forward to the day when the show is returned to its former glory, without Sara Sidle being there to irritate me. **--Linda, Ore.**

I think "CSI" will be better without Sara. I like Sara, I really do. However, I do not like the Grissom-Sara relationship. It seems that this relationship has taken over the show and it has become the Grissom-Sara show. With Sara gone, GSR will be a memory. Perhaps, maybe "CSI" will get back to the business of solving crimes rather than worrying about who's with who. **--Nicole**

It will be much better. Her character was ill-conceived for a CSI professional and was often extremely irritating. Her supposed empathy came off as emotional instability and her feistiness seemed more like passive-aggressive grandstanding. A personality like that would be poisonous in a workplace, but instead she got the big romantic buildup along with a lot of backstory that was just a plea for us to sympathize with her. It was a total failure. And forget the disgusting secret office romance with her long-time father-figure crush. Please let Grissom's character have a renaissance now that this albatross is not around his neck. **--TR, New Jersey**

Better, much better. I don't like to see professional relationships turn into romantic slush on a TV series, and I am very happy that we won't have to watch that happen on "CSI." Fox's voice also annoyed me no end -- whiny, and full of Valley Girl inflections (every sentence ending on a rising note, as if it were a question). I'm so happy she's gone. I just hope she stays gone. I've read some TV gossip that says she might return. **--Bonnie, Ocean Springs, Miss.**

Yay! Until this season, Sara never really bothered me, but for some reason, she is really grating on my nerves now and I'm glad she is going. The whole relationship with Grissom was just plain icky! **--Liz, Milwaukee, Wis.**

"CSI" has a strong cast and can withstand the loss of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). I've grown weary of her perma-sulk as she mopes through the department, voluntarily isolating herself, then staring longingly at everyone as they seem to gel around her. She comes off as a brilliant scientist with the social skills of a 7th grader with the way she scowls with jealousy at any female within 10 feet of Grissom that isn't Catherine and scowls at anyone who looks at Catherine more than at her. I'm over it -- and her. Time to move on. **--Karen, Wisconsin**
