Let us not forget that Jorja is _way more_ than just an actor, she's an advocate who speaks up for the animals. Jorja was, again, on Jane Velez-Mitchell, talking about the movie "Blackfish" which peels back the curtain to look at the real life of animals at Sea World.  This is probably why she didn't live tweet last night, by the way.

The movie Blackfish airs on CNN tonight at 9pm ET. I've set my DVR to record it, because I am typing this on an airplane. I don't think Jorja's on tonight, but ... well I can't tell anymore. By the way, CBS is not the worst about blocking you from downloading video. I had to screenshot this the old way.
