## Synopsis

During a high-profile tournament, Russell Huntley is found dead in his own golf cart. The former course record holder (now held by his son, Danny Nagano), Russell was an antagonistic drunk who was angry towards his son Danny, his ex-wife and many other people.

Russell's ex-wife's sister, Erin, left her prints on a ball found in his golf cart. She buys the balls every time Danny, her step-nephew, plays a tournament. Danny's caddy's prints were also found on the balls, and John Dudek was a former professional golfer, kicked out of the sport for being caught using performance enhancing drugs by none other than Russell Huntley.

Russell dropped a $5000 bet _against_ his son, the day Danny broke the course record, and Russell suspected him of cheating. The CSIs determine that the density of Danny's balls had been altered by his step-aunt, Erin, who works with lasers at UNLV, at the behest of John Dudek, the caddy. Danny had never known about the tampering. When they find Russell's golf bag, they determine he was testing the balls on an unused portion of the golf course, and find evidence that his murderer attacked him there.

Danny admits that he met his father there, to demonstrate that he was capable, but Russell proved to him about the juiced balls. Russell urged Danny to turn himself in, but Danny just walked away as his step-mother, Michelle, drove up and then away. In the end, the death was determined to be accidental. Russell had been banging the golf club on the ground, and the head snapped, bouncing and stabbing him in the neck, severing an artery.

## Review

Sara works with recovering evidence from the golf cart with Ray and Nick, and is somewhat disparaging about golf in general. Later, she and Greg go to investigate the primary crime scene, and Greg questions, friendly-like, the validity of Sara's marriage to Grissom. In turn, Sara momentarily pretends that it was a joke.

## Notes

* Sara isn't a fan of golf.
* Sara and Greg are still sibling-comfortable around each other.
