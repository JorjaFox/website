Back in the summer of 2004, I took a trip out of town to a land of no Internet, for a relaxing week in the hills.  It was summer, CSI was quiet, I thought nothing would happen.  As some of you recall, Jorja was fired that week and I was missing in action.  People freaked.

This week, I went off for a weekend at the SCA (camping out, dressing up in middle ages clothes, the whole nine yards), and had no cell service.  And what happened?  Jorja comes BACK to CSI!

Here's the break down:
<ul>
	<li>Jorja will be on the Sept 24th premiere episode.</li>
	<li>Jorja will be on five episodes total.</li>
	<li>William Petersen IS NOT expected to be there.</li>
</ul>

I'm sure someone out there is mocking me because I had previously announced that, based on the script excerpts I saw, there was no Sara and there was no Grissom.  I **did not** lie to anyone and I **was not** incorrect.  To this day, the parts of the script I've seen, there's no Sara and I didn't see a way to fit her in without a re-write.  I can only assume there was a rewrite, or what I saw will not be the first episode of the season. It happens.

So yes, it's true.  And I'm as delighted as you are!
