CSI CAST OUT FOR BLOOD OVER CSI: NEW YORK: The original CSI cast is up in arms over CBS's decision to add a third edition of the franchise to its 2004-05 schedlue. At the Golden Globes, Marg Helgenberger refused to comment on the record about the new show, but castmate Jorja Fox didn't hold back: "When you do something, you're lucky if people are interested in it, and audiences are very fickle. They have very short attention spans. I thick the quickest thing to make something go away is to overdue it. I'm definitely concerned about this. I think it could shorten the length of our show's life. Everybody has talked about this from the very beginning." CBS pres Leslie Moonves told Scarlet Carpet he won't be asking any of the original cast to help launch the new show. Instead, producers will kick off the new show in Miami, with David Caruso then crossing over to CSI: New York to help launch the premiere.
