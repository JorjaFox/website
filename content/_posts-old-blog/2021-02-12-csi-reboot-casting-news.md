<p>From TV Line comes the news that the <em>CSI</em> reboot is still on the table, and three more actors have been cast to join William Petersen and Jorja Fox.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Although reps for CBS and CBS Studios declined to comment, TVLine has learned that Matt Lauria (<em>Friday Night Lights, Kingdom</em>), Paula Newsome (<em>Chicago Med, Barry</em>) and Mel Rodriguez (<em>Last Man on Earth</em>) have joined the potential event series, which has yet to snag a formal pickup at the Eye network.</p><p>Lauria will play Josh, a Level 3 CSI who excels at crime scene reconstruction, while Newsome will portray Maxine, the new head of the Vegas Crime lab. Rodriguez will play Hugo, the head medical examiner who has a slightly creepy obsession with dead bodies. Two additional roles are still being cast.</p><cite><a href="https://tvline.com/2021/02/12/csi-reboot-cast-matt-lauria-paula-newsome-cbs/"><em>CSI</em> Revival: Matt Lauria, Mel Rodriguez and Paula Newsome Join CBS' In-the-Works Sequel Series</a> - Michael Ausiello, TV Line</cite></blockquote>

<p>It's important to remember that this is still not confirmed by CBS and the show has <strong>not</strong> been officially picked up by CBS. However it is known that there is a script out there, and the original plan was purported to be airing last year, to coincide with the 20th anniversary. Covid kinda messed that one up.</p>

<p>How do you feel about a return to <em>CSI</em>? How would you explain Grissom and Sara coming back?</p>
