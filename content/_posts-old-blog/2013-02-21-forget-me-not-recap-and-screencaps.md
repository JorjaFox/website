<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00536.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6575" alt="vlcsnap-00536" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00536-250x250.jpeg" width="275" height="140" /></a>I said this last night on Twitter: If you came to Jorja via GSR, this episode is very painful. <strong>BUT</strong>. If you started a Jorja fan, this is <strong>THE EPISODE TO WATCH</strong>. I know it was really hard for you guys who are GSR First, but man alive, this was a great episode, and I am livid to know that Jorja probably won't even get an Emmy nomination.

So what happened? What <em>didn't</em> happen!? GSR is done, Sara said Grissom was no longer her husband but admitted she didn't want to believe it was over either. Nick spoke for a lot of the fans, saying that the marriage let them hang on to Grissom.  She didn't cheat on Grissom, though. And she's still wearing her ring at the end.

I wanted a little more momma Sidle, but it's interesting. Basderic slipped her the booze and then told her that Sara stabbed the guy seven times. Lots of great Sara tidbits. Did you notice how DB knew about her mom and that she was in a care facility?

<blockquote>I didn't mean to shut you guys out. I didn't tell you about Grissom and me because I didn't believe it myself. You know we made that dinner reservation together, before we split up. As I sat there, alone, in the restaurant... I honestly expected him to show up.</blockquote>
And I think I want a nap now.
