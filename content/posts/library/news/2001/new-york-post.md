**I never got off the bus**

**Who are your heroes?**

I actually have a lot. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., John Lennon, Oprah Winfrey, Geronimo, Harvey Milk, Maya Angelou, Einstein. All share courage, independent thinking, immense creativity and a passion/compulsion for freedom and equality for all people. Geronimo, the only non-pacifist in the group, never gave up, faced unbeatable odds and persevered with ingenious strategy.

**Is there a book or movie that has changed your life?**

Playboy magazine. No comment [as to why]. "Catcher In The Rye," by J.D. Salinger. No list would be complete without it. I think that book has changed almost everyone's life who's read it. "1984" by George Orwell speaks volumes on anything political that's happened in the last 50 years in my jaded, Generation X opinion.

**What was your worst day ever?**

Hopefully I've had it already. What comes to mind is this day in kindergarten when we had a substitute bus driver, who didn't know the route. I rode the bus for maybe six hours.

**What would you be doing if you weren't doing this?**

Produce. Write. I would've loved to have been a marine biologist, but I don't quite get science and math in general.
