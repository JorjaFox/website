JAA had posted a special video of Jorja at EW's pre-Emmy party (NOT the Ausiello video) earlier today.  They had to take it down tonight because, contrary to their request, it was posted up on YouTube.  I know it may seem unreasonable, in 2008, to expect anything posted on the internet to remain private, to not be shared across flickr, youtube, facebook and myspace.  One of the wonderful things about Jorja-Fans, though, is that you are, by in large, a fantastic, caring and conscientious lot who care for each other.  So it's honestly surprising to me that, after JAA asked for the video not to be shared, it was.

<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/444152.html">They're mad.</a> It's justifiable, seeing as we pride ourselves on being a respectful community. Until the person who posted the video turns themselves in <del datetime="2008-09-24T14:06:35+00:00">(and removes the video from Youtube)</del>, no JAA videos will be available.
