The Journal of <a href="http://www.aada.org/">The American Academy of Dramatic Arts</a> interviewed Jorja (and Eric Szmanda) back in the spring of 2007.  I suspect this article got lost in the hubbub of Jorja leaving _CSI _that year.

My favorite question was this:

<blockquote>**How do you play a character that you do not connect to – or do not like?**

I don’t. If my heart’s not in it, my work really suffers. It’s obvious when I’m not passionate about what I’m doing, which isn’t fair to my employers or me. I’ve had jobs I haven’t loved to pay the rent but never artistic ones. Bartending, temping, that kind of thing. If I don’t care for the story or the role I don’t take the job. </blockquote>

Check out the article in PDF format at <a href="http://www.aada.org/pdf/alumni/americada_2007_01.pdf">AADA.org</a> or, if you can't read the PDF, we have a copy of it on the JorjaPedia: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Journal_of_The_American_Academy_of_Dramatic_Arts_%28Spring_2007%29">Journal of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Spring 2007)</a>
