Search Is Underway For Replacements

Two stars of the CBS hit television series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" were fired for breach of contract and one failed to show up for work, KCBS-TV and Variety reported Thursday.

Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes, were fired after asking for more money to stay on the show, according to the reports.

Danica Smith, publicist for both Fox and Eads, told The Associated Press that Fox was fired Wednesday but did not have details. Smith could not confirm whether Eads was fired.

A CBS spokesman said the network had no comment.

Eads didn't show up for work Thursday, the first day of production for the next season, according to the news station and Variety, which posted a story on its Web site Thursday.

The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts.

Though a search was underway for their replacements, it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones, the reports said.

The show picked up four Emmy nominations Thursday, including one for best drama series.
