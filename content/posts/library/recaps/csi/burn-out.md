## Synopsis

Only by working with a convicted pedophile are the CSI's able to find out what happened to two young boys who go missing. Both come from homes where they don't feel loved and the pedophile confesses, after being spotted in a lineup, that he had been acting as a father figure to the boys. One of the boys is found dead, the other on a bus trying to escape. The pedophile, while he had not molested the boys, had indeed broken the law with them and lead to the death.

## Review

**Sara:** Greg's got the coroner's inquest coming up, he's been under a lot of stress -- maybe you should be a little nicer to him.
