If you're not familiar, the TCAs are the TV Critics' Association's upfront, where networks come to talk about what's coming and how cool it is. <em>CSI: Vegas</em> had a panel where they introduced the new trailer.

<h2>The Panel</h2>

The panel included Jorja Fox, Paula Newsome, Matt Lauria, Mandeep Dhillon, Mel Rodriguez and EPs William Peterson, Anthony Zuiker, and Jason Tracey.

21 years later, we get CSI again. This time, the actors weren't able to do ride-alongs, due to COVID, but everyone is excited. They do want to get more <em>CSI</em> vets back, but Petersen was excited about coming back, even though they were all a little out of date with the work. Jorja said she was more than a little rusty on all things science and just being on a set because of the pandemic.

Jorja also loves seeing women in the leading roles of shows - it's overdue.

What do you think? Is the perp one of the CSI's own?
