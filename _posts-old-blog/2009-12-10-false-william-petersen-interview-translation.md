<a href="http://billypetersen.com/site/2009/12/french-tv-mag-tele-loisirs-translation/"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/wp-french-100x100.jpg" alt="wp-french" title="wp-french" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2149" /></a> This is something I normally would just ignore, because I don't have a problem with this. But. My email box and twitter got blasted about it, so I'm going to address this. I preface it all with the request that you not go out and attack the people who posted this.  Also I'm going to delete any attacks from either side posted here.

So here's what happened.

William Petersen had an interview with a French magazine Tele Loisirs, which the great folks at the William Petersen Appreciation Page (WPAP) posted a <a href="http://billypetersen.com/site/2009/12/french-tv-mag-tele-loisirs-translation/">translation</a> for those of us who only know how to say <del datetime="2009-12-11T16:51:06+00:00">"Le sange conduit le autobus."</del> "Le singe conduit l'autobus" (The monkey is driving the bus - and thank you for correcting me!).

Some of the people who dislike Jorja Fox, and by extension Sara Sidle and GSR, thought it would be funny to post the following as a 'translation':
<blockquote>"I left CSI because I could no longer bear the way the writers were ruining the character I had worked so hard to develop. They put him into a relationship with Sara Sidle. Can you believe it? As if! Grissom loves women, but he loves a certain kind of woman - the feminine kind. Like Lady Heather, who is Grissom's true soul mate. Sara is a chainsaw wielding, unsexy, rough and tough type - not Grissom's type at all. She doesn't even have good personal hygiene! It's the most bizarre, implausible relationship on TV and I was really embarrassed by it. I had to escape. No amount of money could compensate for that. I wish the writers and producers had listened to the true fans, the ones that love CSI and Grissom above all and were opposed to any relationship with Grissom and Sara. They were right. In fact, there's a group of these loyal fans at a message board run by a woman named Elyse. These fans are the best - brilliant, insightful and right on target when it comes to knowing Grissom. But they were ignored and as a result, CSI has been all but destroyed. I have to do this Paris episode because of a contractual obligation, but I would rather be anywhere but here. CSI has become nothing but a vehicle for a cult of Sara Sidle fans and that's not what I had in mind for this show. And all because some of these cultists sent Carol a few boxes of Cracker Jacks or something."</blockquote>

It was a _joke_, which many people found distasteful, and many others took offense to because it, and a great deal of the other posts on that site, denigrate both William Petersen and Jorja Fox.  Of course, the original posters were quick to jibe that the Jorja fans would claim this was a false translation, and said WPAP and other sites, though curiously (to me) not JFO, would decry it as lies, being unable to handle the 'truth.'

And I admit, when I read that on December 7th, I smirked, rolled my eyes and thought 'Some people's kids.' and moved on without much thought to the matter.  I saw it for the joke it was and I didn't find it personally offensive. I've read a lot worse tossed at Jorja and her fans in the last 12 years (12! Happy Anniversary JFO!). In fact, I find it a little hysterical that some people took that translation as even possibly serious and legitimate.  While I don't claim to know Petersen's interviews the way I know Jorja's (I can spot a fake Jorja interview at 50 paces), I didn't think it read like him at all.  Not to mention that Jorja's name isn't even in the French version of the article and there was no reply long enough to warrant that verbose a translation.

The translation is a lie, and the site that produced it (Elyse's CSI forum) was de-linked from JFO a couple months ago due to their Anti-Jorja sentiment. I did contact Elyse when I de-linked her site back then, as we've historically been rather friendly with each other, and frankly, I like her. I have no plans of contacting her again about these developments, since I never added the site back to JFO and thus I don't matter.  And I'm not a snitch. It's her site, she can do what she wants and I'm cool with that.  Personally I think it's sad that members of her forum have decided ad hominem personal attacks on actors is the way to go, but it's **not** my site and I have neither authority nor responsibility over then.

I **do** have responsibility here, however, both to you and to Jorja Fox.

If you bring flame wars with anti-Jorja sites back here, your posts will be removed.  If you bring the war to them, you're gonna get burnt and angry and I'm going to say 'Told you so.'  They have every right to their opinion, just as you have the right to yours.  I respect that and, while I don't agree that Jorja's ugly or a bad actress, they're welcome to their opinion. I feel that David Caruso's not attractive and I don't like his acting style (same idea, nicer words) but that's why I don't go to David Caruso: Online, and that's why the Anti-Jorja people don't come here.  I recommend you **NOT** go to anti-Jorja sites and defend her, and I support those sites in their right to remove your posts and block you.  There's no 'freedom of speech' online, and they have the same rights to remove posts they find offensive as I do here.

I'm going to leave comments open here, if people have questions about the validity of the WPAP's **accurate **translation (which it is, so don't claim WPAP are liars, folks), etc.  Let it go.  Leave the hate at the door.
