By now everyone's heard the latest craze in the remake world is none other than <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/memento/">Memento</a>.

THR reported that <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolans-memento-get-remake-840587">AMBI Pictures, run by Andrea Iervolino and Monika Bacardi, has announced it will finance and produce the remake.</a>

Jorja played the part of Catherine Shelby, the deceased (maybe?) wife of Leonard Shelby, and the cause for his rather bizarre murder spree.

I'm not really thrilled about it. That's a great movie, if incredibly confusing, and I don't know how a remake would make it any better.
