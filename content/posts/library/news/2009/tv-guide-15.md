Jorja Fox will be returning to "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" this season indefinitely, TVGuide.com has confirmed.

"We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja," executive producer Carol Mendolsohn tells EW. " This season is about bringing the ["CSI"] family back together again ... Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team."

The length of Fox's stay remains unknown but it will definitely be more than the five episodes she was originally scheduled for. "As many episodes as we can have Jorja for, we want her for," Mendolsohn told EW, which was the first to report the news.

Fox left "CSI" in 2007 but has returned to the show multiple times since. Her character, Sarah Sidle, is married to former team leader Gil Grissom, played by William Peterson. Peterson left the show last season and will not be returning to the show to coincide with his on-screen wife's appearance.
