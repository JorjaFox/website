**Question: Jorja Fox's last "CSI" episode just aired, and that got me to thinking about all the brouhaha back when the relationship between Grissom and Sara was revealed in the Season 6 finale. At the time, there were dire predictions that this was the end of the rope for the series. It had become a soap, turned a corner, jumped the shark, etc. Looking back at it now, do you think that the romance -- its reveal, and the way it was woven into Seasons 7 and 8 -- was a detriment to the show? An asset? My personal opinion is that the creators did a very nice job of keeping the relationship believable and not letting it overtake the procedural nature that is the show's hallmark. That said, Season 7 was perhaps one of "CSI"'s best, not because of the romance storyline but because of the writing (the "miniature killer" and Liev Schreiber arcs) and the artistic gambles the creators took: dead bodies that spoke, a "monster movie"-style episode, the incredibly cute "clip show" featuring the lab rats. -- Sandra S.**

Matt Roush: Couldn't agree more. "CSI" is more nimble than most at balancing the procedural storylines (the real draw on this and nearly every crime franchise) with the personal subplots, which rarely intrude or overtake the series. Not only is "CSI" among the best of its type at telling clever and creepy crime stories (last season was among its most sustained), but the unusual relationship between Grissom and Sara ranks high as well in terms of the subtlety and complexity of the writing and performances of both William Petersen and Jorja Fox. Rare for this sort of show, the relationship didn't cheapen the series but made the characters that much more intriguing. Allowing Sara to exit with dignity, while leaving the door open for the character to reappear eventually, was also a smart move.
