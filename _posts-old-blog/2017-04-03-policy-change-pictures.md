With a few rare exceptions, such as photos posted by public figures, I will no longer be reposting people's _personal_ photos of Jorja anymore.

In the age of social media, people get a lot of photos of meeting stars, and while that's cool, it's also a little creepy to collect them up online without their consent. This means that if people post images to their Facebook pages of meeting Jorja at an event or such, I won't be reposting it here. However event sanctioned photos like the ones you see on the event Facebook page, their own domain, or Getty, will still be added to the gallery.

This is less about Jorja's privacy and more about global privacy.

I've been going through the photos I have and removing the ones I feel infringe on the privacy of people who didn't agree to be on this site. If I have some of your photos up, please <a href="https://jorjafox.net/contact/">let me know</a> and I'll remove them right away. If you have photos you'd _like_ for me to include, also let me know. I'm happy to do so if you and everyone in the photo is okay with that.

Frankly I see this as a massive oversight on my own part. I should have been more aware, and I'm sorry I wasn't.
