<span class="alignright">[polldaddy poll=1439309]</span> As I prepared my monthly address to the JFOers, it struck me that I really need a snappier name for you all!  The JFO Nation?  JFOers? Jorja's Guys and Girls? I made a poll so you could vote (and this may be the start of a 'poll of the month' deal).

So let's get down to the stuff you give a hoot about!

<strong>Jorja Fox</strong>
It's been a quieter month, with some news about <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/03/03/animal-acres-updates/">Animal Acres events</a> and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/03/04/did-george-eads-call-jorja-a-diva/">DivaGate (or: Did George call Jorja a 'diva'?)</a>.  There was a blip sighting of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/03/22/doyle-sighted-again/">Doyle's name on <em>ER</em></a>, but no verbal mention of our heroine.

For the Grissom/Sara fans, William Petersen called Sara the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/03/11/petersen-sara-is-the-heart-of-grissom/">heart of Grissom</a>.  As "One To Go" finally aired in the UK, there were some late reviews of the final episode, and many with Sara in mind:

<strong>Community</strong>
Sometimes I have links to other blogs and all that I'm not sure what to do with. Like, how do you classify a blog post about CSI, animal activism and a little bit of Jorja Fox?  So I'm going to try listing the links here about articles that are related to Jorja Fox in a Venn Diagram, but I can't find a home for. Yet.

<strong>The Site</strong>
Within one week, you guys had clicked on enough ads to pay for the site for that month.  Read that again. One week of clicking equals one MONTH of website fees. I salute you! The month ended with a $12/week average, and that will really keep the site ahead of the game. Please keep clicking on the ads you like, it's really helping a lot! I'll be renewing the domain for 20 years as soon as the Google check clears.

I freely admit that I did word the title of some news posts with the intent of drawing attention to the site (notable DivaGate).  The intent was to get people to read, and once reading, suck them in to our web of awesome.  Controversy breeds conversation on the web, and I'm not sorry or ashamed I did that.  Part of this site is just to show the world how cool Jorja is, but that would fail if I didn't attract new 'viewers.'

Speaking of attracting readers, I'm really fond of Twitter.  At first I was just dumping posts into and didn't follow anyone. Now I'm following just about every fan who follows JFO (I'm trying to follow as many as I can, even non-English ones). Exceptions are any commercial site I can't connect for Jorja, which means if your site has a Jorja-Product or such, Tweet @jorjafoxonline and let me know!  As for 'What is Twitter good for?'  I use it for 'breaking' news that isn't ready for blog posts, or short info updates that affect the community. It's not for everyone, though, I agree, which is why the blog will remain as is!

For the folks who noticed those 'related posts' links at the bottom of entries, those are to help you find posts similar to the one you're reading.  It's automated and I'm tweaking it as we go to make it more accurate. The front page of the site now notes what 'page' of featured posts you're on, so you know how far through the cycle you are. And lastly, I flipped the site to 'fixed width' because of comments from people on older computers.  This had the side effect of making the site pretty on IE 6 and IE 5! I know, shocking.
