<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2010/facebook-rumors-are-unconfirmed/facebook-qs/" rel="attachment wp-att-2511"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/07/facebook-qs-100x100.png" alt="" title="facebook-qs" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2511" /></a> I know there are rumors running around Facebook right now that Jorja has "signed on for all of season 11."  Those are just what you think they are: _rumors_.

We should expect Jorja to be back next season, but right now it would be wildly presumptuous to say if it's for the whole season or not.

Simply put: I still don't know.

Not that I'm the be-all and end-all of all this, but even I wouldn't trust me until I cite a source saying she's back full time.  Unless it comes from someone who should know (like a certain writer we know and love who happens to post on Facebook or Twitter, for example), don't get super concerned about it.

All in due time.
