As promised, here's my interview with CSI's veggie-lovin' babe Jorja Fox. Spoilerphobes, read at your own risk!

**Ausiello: Hi, Jorja.**

**Jorja: **Sorry I'm a few minutes late. My very good friend, Eric Szmanda, who plays Greg Sanders, just did his last scene of the season, so there was a good three minutes of hugging going on.

**Ausiello: You won't see him now until July?**

**Jorja: **No, I'm probably going to see him tomorrow night. He and I are very close. Tomorrow is my wrap day, so I think we're gonna all go out tomorrow night and have drinks after work. He'll probably start drinking today; I'll be waiting until tomorrow.

**Ausiello: What's going on in your final scene?**

**Jorja: **I can't give anything away, but we have a cliff-hanger at the end of this season that I think you guys are going to have a field day with. All I can say is that it's going to be good and it's going to come completely out of left field. I think everyone's going to end Season 6 with their jaws dropped.

**Ausiello: Does it involve anything romantic between Sara and Grissom?**

**Jorja: **I don't kiss and tell. God bless that story line. It's been around since the first episode of Season 1, and Billy and I have known one thing and it's that we never really know when they're going to bring it out; it's always a surprise. So I'm not going to give away any details. All I can say is that I think this cliff-hanger will be quite surprising for everybody. If you're a fan of the show, don't miss it.

**Ausiello: Does it involve \***** getting shot?**

**Jorja: **There are two cliff-hangers in the finale, one will involve \*****. There's a melding of cliff-hangers in the last episode, which is rare for our show. We don't do them that much. We don't do cliff-hangers per se, but sometimes we'll throw something really crazy into the mix right before the end of the year.

**Ausiello: Most of my CSI mail is about Sara-Grissom. Fans want you two to get together.**

**Jorja: **No kidding? It's funny because Billy and I are always so sure that everyone's just bored to tears with that story line. We've been sort of beating that horse for six years.

**Ausiello: Switching gears, you and I have something in common.**

**Jorja: **Really?

**Ausiello: We're both nominated in PETA's World's Sexiest Vegetarian poll.**

**Jorja: **We are?

**Ausiello: Yes. Have you voted yet?**

**Jorja: **No! I didn't even know about this at all. I'm so embarrassed.

**Ausiello: If you go to GoVeg.com, you'll see it.**

**Jorja: **I'll vote for both of us, like, 20 times. Congratulations!

**Ausiello: Congratulations to you, too. I think we can win.**

**Jorja: **If we vote continuously. When do the polls close?

**Ausiello: In a few weeks.**

**Jorja: **Oh, wow. That's a lot of voting.

**Ausiello: I don't know what we win.**

**Jorja: **Maybe it's a date with each other.

**Ausiello: Maybe. We could go to a vegetarian restaurant.**

**Jorja:** (Laughs) Totally!

**Ausiello: You're featured in a new PETA campaign with the slogan "Investigate Vegetarianism." How did that come about?**

**Jorja:** I've been a member of PETA forever. I was very active when I lived in New York City, which I did for many years. They'd have protests and things of that nature, and I was very active in doing stuff like that. And just this year PETA moved to Los Angeles. They have an office in Silver Lake, which is totally exciting for those of us in L.A. And that's sort of how I got in contact with them. And so they approached me with the idea, and I jumped at the chance.

**Ausiello: Did you get permission from CSI? The ad leans heavily on your connection to the show.**

**Jorja:** To be honest, I didn't really ask for permission; I probably should have. I didn't see that there was anything controversial - or even confrontational - about the ad. I think that as far as PETA's concerned, it's one of their gentler ads. But we'll see. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble. But I somehow doubt it. It's a pretty supportive group around here.

**Ausiello: Do you make your costars feel guilty about eating meat?**

**Jorja:** That's rarely my style. Billy has just become a vegetarian in the last couple of months.

**Ausiello: Due to your influence?**

**Jorja:** No, his wife has been a vegetarian for a long time and I think it's just a combination of things. He's sort of been on a health kick anyway. And he loves animals.

**Ausiello: What are you doing on your hiatus?**

**Jorja:** I produced a play in L.A. two years ago called Dear Bernard. It's an original musical and we've been invited to take the show to London at Riverside Studios this summer. So that's my big summer project. We have a three-week run there. It's a risk, but it was a risk I couldn't pass up.

**Ausiello: How long do you see yourself doing CSI?**

**Jorja:** Sky's the limit. In about 24 hours I will have completed my 10th consecutive year on prime-time television, starting with ER in 1996. I thought to myself over the years that it would be really cool to do 10 years on TV, and now I'm about to hit that mark. So from this point on there's no script. It's unchartered territory.

**Ausiello: But you'll be back in the fall, right?**

**Jorja:** Yeah, I'll be back. I'm getting a little older and there are some other things that I'd like to do, so from time to time I think that maybe it's about time to move on and do something different. I'm not getting any younger. But I'm not ready to let this go.
