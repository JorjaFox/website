## DRAMA

**CSI: Crime Scene Investigation**

**CBS, 9/8c** Good-bye Sara Sidle! It won't be the same without workaholic Sara, but after tonight's episode the criminologist who ranks No. 1 in the hearts of many viewers -- not to mention Gil Grissom -- parts ways with the crime lab when a case comes back to haunt her.

## BYE-BYE, JORJA!

**CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS, 9/8c)** TV loses its Fox-iest lady tonight as Sara hangs up her goggles and heads out of Grissom's life. What a "Crime", indeed.

## So Long, Sara!

**As Jorja Fox leaves the lab this week, we recall the CSI's five greatest moments**

### Too Tough To Die

"Season 1" This heartbreaking story (a woman is sexually assaulted when shot, and will die if the bullets lodged in her brain are removed) spotlights two themes: Sara as an obsessed crusader for victimized women and how devoted Grissom (William Petersen) is to her. "You're going to spend all your time in hospitals trying to help the people you couldn't save," he warns. She counters, "I wish I was like you ... I wish I didn't feel anything."

### Play With Fire

"Season 3" A bonanza for Fox-philes: After surviving a lab explosion, Sara returns to the job fearless, even reckless -- kicking open a suspect's door, gun drawn ... then asks Grissom out! in near-palpable pain, he declines, saying of their tortured relationship: "I don't know what to do about this." Fun fact: Grissom's touching observation of her post-blast wound, ""Honey", this doesn't look good," was ad-libbed by Petersen.

### Nesting Dolls

"Season 5" During a spousal-murder investigation, an enraged Sara insults CSI Catherine (Marg Helgenberger), defies lab supervisor Ecklie (Marc Vann) and gets suspended. When Grissom visits her (at home!), she confesses that her abused mother killed her father, which landed her in foster care. Sara then breaks down and Grissom tenderly takes her hand. Awww ...

### Way to Go

"Season 6" This episode signed off with the long-yearned-for disclosure that our two star-crossed criminalists had finally hooked up. Sweet, and a little morbid, it occurs doing a bedroom discussion of death, with Grissom noting that he'd like to "have enough time to say goodbye to the people I love." A grinning Sara purrs, "I'm not ready to say goodbye."

### Dead Doll

"Season 8" The sight of a traumatized, dehydrated Sara wandering the desert after her abduction by the Miniature Killer speaks volumes about her dogged survival instinct as well as her essential loneliness (a trait she and Grissom have in common). Then there's that heart-wrenching payoff, as exec producer Carol Mendelsohn recalls: "I cry every time I see [that scene] when Grissom finally finds her.
