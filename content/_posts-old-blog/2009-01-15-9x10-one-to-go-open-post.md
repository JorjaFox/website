<blockquote>"One To Go" - The CSI team is shocked and saddened when, after working with Dr. Raymond Langston on the "Dick & Jane" murders, Grissom announces that his time as a CSI has come to an end and offers Langston a permanent position on the CSI team, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, Jan. 15 (9:15-10:16 PM, ET/9:00-10:01 PM PT) on the CBS Television Network. </blockquote>

Post your rumors, spoilers, spec and hopes (and comments about the epsiode) here.  After the episode airs, I'll post again if there are to be screecaps and a recap.

**UPDATED** Bless you Canada! Jorja is in this episode, in the last minute. There is no dialouge. Please don't keep hitting refresh, I won't have screencaps until about 11:30pm ET.

Of course, given what the newspapers say today... (spoilers below the cut)

<em>Update - 1pm ET</em>
<blockquote>In the final minutes, however, there's actually sunshine and an ending similar to Julianna Marguiles' departure from "ER"; for fans, it's a fine payoff.</blockquote>
