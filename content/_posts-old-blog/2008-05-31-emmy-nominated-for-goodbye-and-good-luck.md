No one's shocked.  Jorja's listed in round one for an Emmy.  As we can learn from last year, <i>Greys Anatomy</i> tends to suck up the slots for Best Actress, but here's hoping.  Personally, I thought "Dead Doll" was a strong episode (what shows acting chops more than selling an episode with almost no dialogue?), but Jorja was certainly in the news for this one.  She is currently the <b>only</b> <i>CSI</i> actress from any of the three shows to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress. No one from <i>Greys</i> is nominated in that category.
