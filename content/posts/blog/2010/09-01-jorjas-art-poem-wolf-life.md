<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/personal/artwork/spiritgallery-001.jpg"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="Spirit Gallery / WCC" title="Spirit Gallery / WCC" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/personal/artwork/spiritgallery-001_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg"  /></a> Jorja's art is a signed photograph with 'Thanks for helping out the wolves! Jorja Fox' and an original poem.  (Yes, you can click on the little image there to see a bigger one.)

The photo and poem will be for sale at the “Majestic Beauty” **live** auction (so yes, you have to be there to bid), to be held on Saturday, Oct. 23, at 6 p.m. The event itself is free, though not all celebs who donated art are expected to be there.

All event proceeds benefit the Wolf Conservation Center (WCC).

But you probably want to see Jorja's poem:

<blockquote>**Wolf Life**

Standing on
the threshold, like
an astronaut or deep
sea diver. I'm in the company of wolves.  And
I'm amazed when you run like the wind
my friend, you save us all from a
soul less world.
</blockquote>
