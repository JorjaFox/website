**CSI Files:** Three cast members departed "CSI" within the space of a calendar year, starting with Jorja Fox back in season eight.

**Hall:** Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) was one of my closest friends on the show, and she just needed to move on in her life. I miss her every time I go on the lot, but she's surfing in the morning, getting ready to do some movie or something, and I think she's happy as a clam. It's wonderful to see somebody do what they want to do and be happy and I would have to say Jorja is quite happy.

**CSI Files:** Grissom and Sara were sent off in a really positive way, and in such a way that they certainly could return.

**Hall:** They didn't get heart attacks and die. If we have some sort of reunion show, I'm sure they'll come up. I was reading on the computer yesterday that Billy was saying something about a "CSI" movie, so I would wager that they would all be there for that.

**CSI Files:** Do you have any favorite episodes or any favorite Doc Robbins moments?

**Hall:** [...] Jorja was always very serious, Marg is a voluptuous woman-it's always nice working with her. [...]
