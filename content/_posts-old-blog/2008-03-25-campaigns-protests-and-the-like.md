At this time, JFO will not be supporting any campaign, protest or similar that has a goal of getting Jorja Fox to return to CSI, or urging CBS to re-hire her.  Jorja's leaving was her own decision and we support it wholeheartedly.  As such, we ask that you not post comments to the blog about such things, or we will delete them.  On JFO, we ask you respect Jorja's choices.

<i>Update</i>: This is not against any specific campaign or website.  It's a blanket sort of statement intended to draw a clear line. If you're not sure where your campaign falls, email webmaster @ jorjafox.net with the campaign details and/or URL and we'd be happy to check it out.
