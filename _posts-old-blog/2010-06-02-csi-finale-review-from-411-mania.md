Bryan Kristopowitz looses points for calling her 'Sarah', but he does adress the concerns we all have.  To whit: What the hell's going on!?

<blockquote>I read that several cast members' contracts are up and that some of them might not be coming back. Fishburne is coming back, and it sounds like the network and producers are going to do whatever it takes to keep Marg Helgenberger happy, so who do you think can the show do without? Will George Eads be sent packing? Will Jorja Fox's Sarah be sent back to the jungle or wherever to hang out with Grissom (and when the hell is he coming back for a guest starring bit? November sweeps?). Will Jim Brass get a pink slip? </blockquote>
