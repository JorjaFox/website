There have been fires in California, and due to an early and already devastating fire season in the Antelope Valley, they need to clear out the evacuation center to have it available if there's another fire.  That means 300 animals need a home! If you or someone you know can adopt two or more companion goats, please email: info@animalacres.org

Good News.

The annual Animal Acres Gala is September 11th, and Jorja's expected to be there.  You can donate (or buy tickets) on AnimalAcres.org
