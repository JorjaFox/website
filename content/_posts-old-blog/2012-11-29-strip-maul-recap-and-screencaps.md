<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/11/stripmaul-097.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6001" title="stripmaul-097" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/11/stripmaul-097-276x140.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="140" /></a>I really enjoyed this episode. The 3D printer phenomenon is amazing (if you get the chance, read <a href="http://craphound.com/makers/">Makers</a> by Cory Doctorow, it's awesome), though a 3D gun isn't as easy as they made it seem. It's not like you can just put in the specs and be done, you have to take into account all the moving parts, the strength of the materials, and ... well it's a mess. But that aside, the way they wove the layers into last night's episode was amazing. Everything flowed in and out very naturally. And Paul G. makes a girl want to invite Brass over to feed him.

Only thing I wish? There had been more Sara. But we'll get that in two weeks with the anticipated "Risky Business Class."
