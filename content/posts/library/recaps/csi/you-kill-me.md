## Quotes

**Brass:** Have you been in touch with Sara?\
**Grissom:** We've talked a little.\
**Brass:** So where's she at?\
**Grissom:** San Francisco, visiting her mother.\
**Brass:** No _(chuckles)_ that's nice. No, what I meant was, where's she at emotionally, you know, with respect to the two of you?\
**Grissom:** I can't speak for her.\
**Brass:** So speak for yourself.\
**Grissom:** I can't talk, I'm really busy.

**Catherine:** Oh. Well, maybe you should take a few days off, for once in your career. I mean, you've got enough stored up. _Go after her._
**Grissom:** It's not what she wants.\
**Catherine:** And what do you want?\
**Grissom:** I want her to be happy.

**Hodges:** You weren't ready. To leave. This, the challenges, the puzzles.\
**Grissom:** _(pause)_ No.\
**Hodges:** But she was.\
**Grissom:** _(pause)_ Yeah, she was.\
**Hodges:** You can't stand in the way of that. _(pause)_ When it's time for someone to move on, you've just gotta let 'em go.\
**Grissom:** Let's play the game, shall we?
