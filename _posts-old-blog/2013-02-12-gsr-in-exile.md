Shane (recently relocated to New York!) from CSI Files posted his interview with Carlos Marimon, writer for tomorrow's episode, "Exile."
<blockquote>**CSI Files**: Will there be any continuing complications in the Grissom (**William Petersen**) and Sara (**Jorja Fox**) area?

**Marimon**: We donâ€™t really visit any of that in this particular episode, but it will come up soon.</blockquote>
Bless them for asking, eh? We will have Sara in the episode though.
