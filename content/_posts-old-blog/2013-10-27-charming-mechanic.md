<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9093" alt="kristoffer_polaha_a_p" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/10/kristoffer_polaha_a_p.jpg" width="166" height="250" />Kristoffer Polaha will guest star in the 10th episode as a "charming" mechanic. According to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/csi-kristoffer-polaha-guest-star-650801">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, he'll be in "Girls Gone Wild" and:
<blockquote>He comes to the aid of Sara (<strong>Jorja Fox</strong>), Finlay (<strong>Elisabeth Shue</strong>) and Morgan (<strong>Elisabeth Harnois</strong>) when their car breaks down, but he may have darker intentions.</blockquote>
Of course he does. It's CSI! Seeing as <a title="Shane Gone Wild" href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/shane-gone-wild/">Shane posted a picture of Jorja with a cut on her head</a>, could this be related?
