## Synopsis

A successful horror-film actress, Weatherly Adams, goes missing and the CSIs are brought in to find her. In their investigation, they find Weatherly wasn't missing at all, but was killed and left staged with other (fake) bodies on the set, an axe lodged in her back. Nick and Catherine search the scene, while Brass interrogates various suspects, including Zarco (a former set worker who had been dating Weatherly. was burned at work and now stalked her) and Vaughn Krunty (aka Zack Putrid, the director who was sleeping with Weatherly).

Weatherly's death was a set related accident, which the owners tried to cover up so as not to lose their bond. In the backstabing and cover-up that follow, all the involved parties die. A cross-dressing Zarco kills Stanley to save Ronnie, and avenge Weatherly's death.

## Review

Wendy was in one of the horror films by Mr. Putrid, which she shows to the Lab Rats and Sara. Sara leaves and Greg finds her in the locker room, where Sara confides that she's sick of death in Las Vegas.

## Notes

* Sara is tired of death, and she is realizing what almost happened to her out in the desert.

## Quotes

**Sara:** You know how in slasher movies, when they go after the dark-haired girl, she always dies?\
**Greg:** Yeah. And the blond always lives. Well aren't you glad it wasn't a movie?\
**Sara:** _(desperate laughter)_ I think, um .. I think I am sick of having my face shoved in death every day. The murder rate has gone up every year since I've been here. It's totally out of control and we're not even slowing them down.
