You know the drill, right? If you don't want to read spoilers, you don't read any post that gets tagged "spoiler" and yes, I tag every post, and I try to make sure that the titles and excerpts you see on social media warn you. Any time after an episode has first aired, there are no spoilers. This means even if Canada gets the episode two hours before New York, spoiler warnings are lifted in the episode posts.

Okay! So here's what they said at the TCA:
<blockquote>It may only be July, but it’s never too early to get caught up on where CSI left off in May. And there’s no time like the present for a sneak peek at some surprises coming up this fall.

SEASON FINALE: The CSI team realized they had a serial killer on their hands as Russell pieced together the reasons why. Morgan went undercover to get close to the killer and went missing, along with Captain Brass’ daughter.

NEW SEASON: In the season premiere, the CSIs delve into the world of reality television when the contestants on a food competition show turn out to be using odd ingredients. In the series’ 300th episode, the CSI “Old Guard” look back to where each of them were when the show began, as they revisit a cold case that’s haunted them for 14 years.</blockquote>
