The posts are surprisingly popular to readers, but not commentators, so this month I'd like to know if you have any suggestions or ideas of what should be in these posts!  Should I stop them and assume people have the impetus to search, or do you find them useful?  Is there something missing?

On to the news!

<h2>CSI</h2>
After shutting down a mess of YouTube accounts run by fans, CBS turned around and made their own clip-site on YouTube, available for all countries (or at least I've not heard of anyone _not_ having access).  I posted all the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x10-418427-videos/">CSI 11x10 "418/427" Videos</a>, but you can see more at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CSI">http://www.youtube.com/show/csi</a>.

Speaking of YouTube, eagle eyed site posters found a couple old videos to delight.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/gsr-in-season-7/">CSI Season 7 clips about GSR</a>, and the infamous <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-season-9-grissoms-goodbye/">CSI Season 9 interview where Billy said Sara is the heart of Grissom</a>. Awww.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x11-man-up-discussion-post/">"Man Up"</a> aired without Jorja, so most of you skipped that episode.  I half-watched.  The same cannot be said of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x12-a-kiss-before-frying/">"A Kiss Before Frying"</a>, which guest starred Dita Von Teese.  No Jorja, but I did watch.

<div class="alignright">[polldaddy poll=4477486]</div> Looking forward, we have, of course, "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" to look forward to, certainly, with the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x13-the-two-mrs-grissoms-press-release/">press release telling us it'll air Feb 3rd</a>.  Then we got <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x13-the-two-mrs-grissoms-stills/">stills</a> and then we got some <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/marlee-matlin-two-mrs-grissoms/">spoilers from Marlee Matlin</a> and a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x13-the-two-mrs-grissoms-promo-video/">promo video</a>. Oh and did you know <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/tvline-exclusive-grissom-returning/">Grissom's returning for this episode</a>?

We also have some potential bright spots in "All That Cremains" with Jorja and Katee Sackhoff.  Jeffery Hunt (former cameraman turn director) posted <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-11x14-all-that-cremains-has-jorja-and-katee/">a picture of Jorja and Katee</a>, which I'm sure will make some fangirls squee.  I'm not above pandering.

<h2>3 Weeks to Daytona</h2>
It didn't end up at Sundance.  There was some major miscommunication running around about that, and I'm still at a loss as to why I was told one thing and then another but, you know, it's okay.  We got an <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/official-daytona-teaser/">official teaser</a> and some awesome <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/3-weeks-to-daytona-photos/">behind the scenes photos</a>, so that's all good!  It looks like a private screening will be March 1st, and hopefully we'll hear more then!

<h2>$750 for Animal Acres</h2>
We did it! We totally raised $750 for Animal Acres!  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/winter-fundraiser-success/">We? Rock!</a>

<h2>Silly Voting Things</h2>
You all know I don't take this stuff really seriously, but there were some amusing 'Vote for Jorja!' moments this month.  We accidentally skewed the results when <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/whos-your-favorite-fox/">DawgSports asked Who's Your Favorite Fox</a>, and hopefully can do the same for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/tv-guide-fan-favorites/">TV Guide's TV Insider Fan Favorites</a>, which allows write ins.

<h2>The Site In General</h2>
There was a lot of behind the scenes cleanup of code this winter.  Not much affected anyone but me, though logged in users now get a pretty cool profile sidebar, if I do say so myself.  I'm setting up a couple new site sections, trying to keep the links in the header shorter.  There will, soon, be a section for community help and a repository of all the questions people have asked, that just don't make it in the FAQs.
