<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/jo-rwanda.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/jo-rwanda-100x100.jpg" alt="jo-rwanda" title="jo-rwanda" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2102" /></a> I'm terrible at fundraisers.  I just am. I envy those people who can sort all this out and do it well.  In addition, I am in awe of people who just drop their lives to do the right thing over and over again.  So when Jo (better known to most of you as **hodiestoe**) dropped me a note to ask for some help raising $6000 to go to Rwanda for a year and teach, I told her "I'm terrible at fundraisers, but I will pimp the hell out of that for you at JFO!"

The community is what makes this site what it is, and as much as I put out there for you, the ceaseless good you return to me and other CSI/Jorja fans is enough to make a girl teary eyed!  Jo's running this off Grissom/Sara fan forums **Your Tax Dollars at Work**.  I really hope that the non GSR folks won't run and hide, and instead might listen to what Jo says about why she's doing this, and possibly help her out:

<blockquote>As many of you will know by now I am going out to Rwanda in December as a volunteer. I am going under the auspices of a non-profit organization called WorldTeach run by Harvard University. I will live and work at a Rwandan school, teaching English to Rwandan high school students and aiding teachers with writing of schemes of work for their students. I also hope to get involved with efforts to help prevent the spread of AIDS in the region by volunteering for other local organizations.

Learning English is of particular importance to the Rwandese as the government has recently changed its official international language from French to English. Consequently students are being taught in a language that they do not know and teachers are devising schemes of work in a language that is not even their second language. Additionally, it is now a pre-requisite for students qualifying for higher education.

Rwanda faces many challenges; the legacy of an horrific genocide, dealing with the prosecution of Genocidaires, the result of a diminished generation of people, the economic ramifications to a country that is trying to stand on its own two feet and reduce their reliance on Western Aid and the devastating effects of the HIV virus. Rwanda also lacks qualified teachers, as a significant majority of them were slaughtered in the 100 days of violence in 1994. Education is a way to help Rwanda address all of these challenges, and schools there are eagerly seeking outside help. As a teacher myself, I believe it is the best way for individuals to make a positive contribution and it also provides a way out of the vicious circle that poverty creates.

As with any undertaking there is a significant cost involved; the cost of my placement, training, air fare, health and travel insurance and field support is almost £4000 ($6000). Through various fundraising efforts I have managed to raise £2500 ($4000) which has amazed me. Dev agreed a little while ago to a CSI fundraiser on here and we have spent the last month or so amassing an incentive for you to enter.

I have undertaken many volunteer positions in Africa before, but none as extensive as this. In the past I have worked in the African Children’s Choir boarding school teaching the choir children past and present. I have also worked out in the choir children’s communities, training teachers, liaising with Social Services on the behalf of families and delivering of food aid. All of that was short term, 5-9 weeks long, this current mission is initially for a year but hopefully longer.

It does mean that I will miss CSI and WP’s eventual return (because you know it WILL happen) but in the grand scheme of things this is much more important. And anyway, you guys will keep me updated with the news and send me out the DVD’s wont you???</blockquote>

Starting Friday night, Jo will post details on how to donate, as well as what those mysterious 'gifts' might be.
