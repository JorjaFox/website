## Synopsis
Connie works the case of Anne Conlin, whose parents find her apartment stripped clean, and Anne never got off the plane after a three month trip to Europe. Johnny works a case of kids who goe missing after a party on the South Side. Carlos hunts down Jerome Vincent, whose car is found abandoned in a parking lot with a suicide note, but no body. Meanwhile Bobby tries to find his mother the perfect birthday present.

## Review
Connie works on the Anne Conlin case, the oldest daughter whose boyfriend, Scott, died seven months before. The airline reports that Anne never caught the flight out to Europe, she never applied for a passport, and she paid her apartment for three months in advance, and cleaned out her bank account. Connie goes to talk to the feds, trying to find out if she'd been tossed in witness protection. Anne's boyfriend's parents claimed he died of cancer, but he had AIDS, and Anne was the only one who took care of him. Her best friend was afraid that Anne caught AIDS as well and died alone.

Scott's parents know more about what happened to Anne, but refuse to talk about it. Connie determines Anne fell in with an underground AIDS ring, as no one really understood AIDS in 1993. Scott's father relents, and leaves Connie a note saying which hospice Anne checked into, but the hospice refuses to share patient information. The doctor does pass on Connie's information to Anne, in the hopes of encouraging reconciliation with Anne and her parents. Anne does contact Connie and agrees to see her and, eventually, to speak to her parents.

## Notes
* Connie adopts a Columbo schtick when interrogating families, pretending to be simple minded in order to draw out information.
