## Synopsis

When a report of shots fired near Catherine's house comes in, the CSIs immediately fear the worst and investigate. They find Russell's SUV and his and Catherine's cell phones, abandoned nearby, with blood on the scene. The bullet holes in her house match the FN-P90  which make Mark Gabriel a likely suspect. However the incompetence of the hitmen make them think Mark Gabriel is being set up.

Catherine survives being shot , thanks to Doc Robbins and an old stripper friend, but has to stay on the run because of a leak in police department communications. To stay off the radar, Russell and Catherine get smuggled into the lab in body bags, and work with the CSIs to find out who framed Catherine's resignation and tried to kill her.

Going back over the remains from the burnt car, they find that Agent McQuaid and Laura Gabriel faked their deaths and planned to blackmail Mark Gabriel. They turned the tables on Laura, getting her husband to buy the hitmen, and McQuaid was killed by his own men when he tried to save Catherine.

## Review

Sara catches Nick up on Laura Gabriel's death when they get the call of shots fired near Catherine's house. Sara correctly makes the connection that the shots are actually at Catherine's house.

Sara makes the connection of Occam's Razor, which is that the simplest solution is usually the right one. Thus they look into Laura.

## Notes

* Sara explains Occam's Razor, showing her scientist background.

## Quotes

**Sara:** I'm going with Occam's Razor. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right answer. And the one that's right in front of you.
