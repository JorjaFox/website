Maybe it's from our constant chiding that the <a href="https://twitter.com/ELEMENTARYStaff">Elementary Writers</a> are way more chatty and inclusive, but the CSI room suddenly jumped to life after almost a month of radio silence.

Well we're devoted to _something_. Maybe not CSI for some of us as much as Sara Sidle...

And then they asked about our fav CSI episodes...

Committed, Crash &amp; Burn, Dead Air, Dead Doll, Dune and Gloom, Empty Eyes, Forget Me Not, Goodbye and Good Luck, House of Hoarders, Nesting Dolls, No Humans Involved, One-hit Wonder, Risky Business Class, Sex, Lies and Larvae, The Two Mrs. Grissoms, Too Tough To Die.

Oh, like you don't have a list!
