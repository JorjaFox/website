## Synopsis

Grissom, Sara and Warrick are called on to investigate an abandoned, blood-splattered apartment and Nick and Catherine must examine a dead scuba diver lodged in a tree. The former tenant of the bloody apartment claims that his missing girlfriend is visiting her parents -- and the parents say she never showed up.

Meanwhile, Nick and Catherine are called to the site of a large fire and are confronted with the scuba diver found dead in the top of a tree near Lake Mead. Is it a murder or an urban legend turned fact?

## Review

At the initial scene, Sara is trying to figure out what made the blood spatter on the walls, and Grissom tells her not to get ahead of herself. Sara spots the vent grid at the apartment, and then the fly egg on the vent. Sara refuses to let go of her theory that the girlfriend is dead, despite Grissom's comments to the contrary.

When she and Grissom are tearing apart the walls with a sledgehammer, Grissom gets frustrated with their lack of progress and goes outside -- Sara follows him out to check on him. She brushes chalk dust off Grissom's cheek, it what may be a comforting or supportive gesture. For Sara, it appears to be an intimate gesture, however Grissom seems confused. This action will come back to haunt them at trial, even though there is apparently no one around to witness it.

After solving the case, Sara and Nick ask Grissom out to breakfast, but he prefers to dine with his beetle.

## Notes

* Sara shows off her mechanical strengths again, when she and Warrick play with the power tools to determine if any of them made the blood spatter.
* In a very (for her intimate moment, Sara brushes chalk off of Grissom's cheek.
