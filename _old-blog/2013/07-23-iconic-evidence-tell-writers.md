Remember when the Writers Tweeted this?

Well they want to know more!
<blockquote>Hey everyone, we posed this question on Twitter, but would like to have a less fleeting forum so we can get more responses.

We're interested in hearing what EVIDENCE from early cases you think is truly iconic. What PHYSICAL EVIDENCE has stuck in your head the most from the last 13 years?

Example: the buffalo pendant from Blood Drops, or the Miniature models from season 7...

We have a decent list of what WE think is iconic, but we'd like to know what the fans' favorites are. List as many as you can think of!</blockquote>
Head over to CSI Files and tell the CSI Writers what the most iconic evidence is for you! Just reply in the <a href="http://talk.csifiles.com/showthread.php?p=1248370#post1248370">Iconic Evidence</a> thread.
