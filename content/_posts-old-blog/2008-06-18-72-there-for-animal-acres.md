We're getting closer!  With just 2 weeks to go, we have a real chance at making it, too!

By the way, those who asked why I'm not offering incentives: my real job matches money I donate up to $2000 for any one charity, provided I meet certain criteria.  Sadly, offering y'all incentive is one of the things I can't do.  But it does mean that my donation will be followed by a matched, anonymous, donation from the company. Personally, I thought that was more important.
