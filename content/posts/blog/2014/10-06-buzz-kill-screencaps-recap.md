An buzz worthy episode for some high times.

Sara doesn't like my jokes but she was in a lot more of this episode. In fact, she was in so many scenes it was a four-star for just that alone! If we'd had more than one tidbit thrown our way about her personal life (Space Bob, heh), we'd be at five! This was the first episode they filmed, and apparently while there had been a plan to film multiples, they've not done so yet. Well. Okay then!

</ul>
Next week, expect a late recap/screencap, I'll be overseas. Yikes! I'll be keeping up with posting, but video may be tricky. When you see next week, you'll understand why Jorja wasn't in a lot of "The CSI Effect." Seriously. Looooots of screentime. Five stars for sure.
