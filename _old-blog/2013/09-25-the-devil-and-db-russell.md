It's time for Season fourteen to hit the air! Screencaps and a recap will probably be up Saturday unless someone else fills in for me (of _course_ I won't be home till then!). Actually I'm not home now... I love being able to schedule things.

Oh right! There's a new episode in a couple hours!

Also Entertainment Weekly has a clip of the funeral. You can watch that video **<a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/09/24/csi-premiere-did-morgan-survive-exclusive/">here at EW.com</a>**.

I don't know how much Sara to expect in this at all. CSI Files' review makes me think 'not much.'
