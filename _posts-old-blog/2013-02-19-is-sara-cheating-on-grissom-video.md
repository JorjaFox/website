HuffPo has an exclusive video!
<blockquote>The February 20 episode of "<a href="http://www.aoltv.com/show/csi-crime-scene-investigation/184657" target="_hplink">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</a>" sees Sara (Jorja Fox) in hot water after a brief encounter with a man leaves her as the prime suspect in his murder case. Even worse -- her interaction with the victim has the team suspecting she's cheating on Grissom (William Petersen).

In The Huffington Post's exclusive clip from Wednesday's Sara/Grissom-centric episode, Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) points out that as far as the rest of the team is concerned, if Sara cheated on her much-beloved husband, she “may as well have cheated on God.”</blockquote>
