You know the ones. The will-they/won't-theys, the ones that make you forget you're watching a procedural for a while and just root on the lovelorn.  Our favorite CSI made the cut.

<blockquote>  - Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) – <em>CSI</em>

This was handled in a different way. There were always hints that Sara and Grissom had a relationship prior to their time at <em>CSI</em>, and then it was suddenly revealed that they had been dating – for years – during the time period of the show. There was never anything explicitly shown, just hints. They wound up married – so it was a happily ever after.
