**Our annual Spotlight Humane gala features dogs, drinks, and fine dining**

Jorja Fox, of the CBS hit crime drama "CSI," will host the fifth annual Spotlight Humane: Chicago fundraiser at the Hotel Sofitel Water Tower on Saturday, Feb. 27, 2010.

The benefit will support End Dogfighting in Chicago, a program of The Humane Society of the United States. EDC is an innovative, community-based program that works to turn Chicagoans away from dogfighting through street-level intervention, free dog training classes, humane education in Chicago public schools, religious leader outreach, and collaboration with law enforcement.

"As a dog lover, I am honored to be the host of The Humane Society of the United States' Spotlight Humane: Chicago," Fox said. "All proceeds from this event benefit the End Dogfighting in Chicago campaign, which reaches directly into high-risk communities. No one else in the country is doing more than The HSUS to end dogfighting."
