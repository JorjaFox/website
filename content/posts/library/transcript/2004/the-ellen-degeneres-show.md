**Ellen DeGeneres** Our next guest is a star of the popular forensic drama, CSI. Watch her at work.

[...]

**Ellen** Please welcome, Jorja Fox!

[...]

**Ellen** Hi!

**Jorja Fox:** Hi! I brought you something.

**Ellen** Merci.

**Jorja** Oh, great.

**Ellen** Merci beaucoup.

**Jorja** That's all I know.

**Ellen** What does that mean, what is this?

**Jorja** Well I know you've been studying a little French on the show, and so I thought these might help; they're French art deco cosmetic labels. You just put 'em on all the products in your bathroom, --

**Ellen** Really?

**Jorja** -- and they're French then.

**Ellen** Lotion vegetale.

**Jorja** Yeah. And it'll help, you know, with the French thing.

**Ellen** What is &#8216;vegetale'?

**Jorja** Umm...

**Ellen** You don't know.

**Jorja** I don't really speak French, no, but I, uh

**Ellen** That's a clever thing, to put stickers on things so you know what it is. I don't, it's not, the problem is the accent really. It's, it's I --

**Jorja** Ah.

**Ellen** -- That's my problem.

**Jorja** Right.

**Ellen** It's not so much that I can't read --

**Jorja** Oh, the &#8216;rrrrrrrrrr.' Can you do that?

**Ellen** Yeah.

**Jorja** &#8216;Rrrrrrr.' You know the French thing.

**Ellen** If I wanted to I could, yeah.

**Jorja** -- where you roll the &#8216;r' thing, ya.

**Ellen** Yeah. I don't, I don't think they do that. That, you're thinking of Charo, I think.

**Jorja** Is that another language? Alright!

**Ellen** No one does &#8216;rrrrrrrr'.

**Jorja** I'm terrible at languages.

**Ellen** No, they do a &#8216;gaaaak'

**Jorja** I think it's a &#8216;rrrrrrrrr'.

**Ellen** A &#8216;rrrrrr'?

**Jorja** &#8216;Rrrrrrrrr'. Yeah, like --

**Ellen** Like what word has &#8216;rrrrrrrr' in it?

**Jorja** Farah. Faragh?

**Ellen** Grrrrraaa

**Jorja** Yeah. Something like that.

**Ellen** All right. No that's not why, that's probably why I don't speak it.

**Jorja** I speak English okay.

**Ellen** Yeah, I, um --

**Jorja** That's about it.

**Ellen** -- I'm barely mastering that.

**Jorja** "(laughing)"

**Ellen** But, but good to see you and I haven't seen you in a long time.

**Jorja** A long time. Y'know I've been wanting to tell you, and I, and I, we've crossed paths several times --

**Ellen** Mmm-hmm.

**Jorja** -- not for a while, and when I first moved to Los Angeles like 8 or 9 years ago - well maybe we won't get into that exactly how long ago - but one of the first things that I ever did, and I know that you won't remember this, was I was invited to Ellen DeGeneres' birthday party. And of course we didn't know each other and you --

**Ellen** No. How were you invited?

**Jorja** Y'know, I knew the uh, y'know, the coat check guy --

**Ellen** Oh.

**Jorja** -- really well --

**Ellen** Ah.

**Jorja** -- yeah, at the Chateau Marmonde, from New York.

**Ellen** Slip him a twenty?

**Jorja** Yeah, yeah, y'know because I bartended there and --

**Ellen** Uh-huh.

**Jorja** -- Yeah. No, mutual friends invited and it was like, it was so huge and I was like fresh from New York City, very excited, here I was in Hollywood, and the first place that I, that I was invited to go to was your party and you were actually very nice to me, I mean until that thing happened in the parking lot...

**Ellen** Uh-huh.

**Jorja** And uh, and uh, I haven't been to any of your birthday parties since, but --

**Ellen** Uh-huh.

**Jorja** -- but it was great, and I remember it, y'know I cherish that.

**Ellen** Yeah, I uh, that was a great party wasn't it?

**Jorja** Yeah, Chateau Marmonde, do you, yeah...

**Ellen** Yes, oh I remember that party.

**Jorja** Like swanky soiree.

**Ellen** Yeah. You have one of these parties that you try to top every year and you just know, it was one of those magical nights that it was so, so cool and people showed up that, I had no idea who a lot of the people were.

**Jorja** Yeah, yeah.

**Ellen** People like you.

**Jorja** Yeah.

**Ellen** But it was fun.

**Jorja** Right.

**Ellen** And what did you bring me? What kind of gift?

**Jorja** A gift? Um, y'know I um, I do not --

**Ellen** Perhaps that's why you --

**Jorja** -- it really wasn't that kind of party I don't think.

**Ellen** No, well they say it's not kind but you still bring a gift.

**Jorja** I remember, I distinctly remember, yeah, &#8216;no gifts', no gifts.

**Ellen** Well I --

**Jorja** In capital letters but I'm making up for it.

**Ellen** Well when people say that you still have to bring a gift. That's, that's why you've not been invited back.

**Jorja** I, I don't think you're uh... Right. You didn't get as much for those as, as you did for the watch, but maybe, y'know --

**Ellen** And I appreciate this.

**Jorja** -- something will come of that.

**Ellen** And I'll look through 'em and maybe say some things later. Um, all right, so uh, so now you've been here for how long? Nine years?

**Jorja** Yeah, I think almost nine years.

**Ellen** And, and where are you living, what area?

**Jorja** Ah, y'know I'm living in Hollywood, I just got a new place --

**Ellen** Mmm-hmm.

**Jorja** -- new house, I'm sleeping on the kitchen, on an air mattress with my dog, and uh --

**Ellen** That's not a good house.

**Jorja** Well, it's, it's a big empty house. Y'know it's funny, I got my dog, I went out --

**Ellen** But why, why are you in the kitchen though?

**Jorja** They've been doing some work in the other, in the rest of the house, in the bedrooms and stuff.

**Ellen** On all the rest of the house? The only thing you're not doing work on is the kitchen?

**Jorja** Yeah, yeah kind of, yeah. Yeah, and I was on friend's couches for a couple of weeks, and that was really fun, and everybody was really gracious, and --

**Ellen** Uh-huh.

**Jorja** -- then I kinda ran out of places to stay so --

**Ellen** Right.

**Jorja** -- now I'm in the kitchen.

**Ellen** Okay, so and, and when is the work going to be done?

**Jorja** I think, y'know they keep saying y'know, &#8216;any day' --

**Ellen** Oh.

**Jorja** -- y'know, 'tomorrow, tomorrow'...

**Ellen** Oh... whatever they say, don't believe 'em.

**Jorja** Yeah.

**Ellen** That's uh, that's, that's, oh, work is...

**Jorja** You know of any good hotels, actually? In the L.A. area?

**Ellen** Sure - Chateau Marmonde.

**Jorja** "(laughs)"

**Ellen** That's a good hotel. All right, so the season finale of "CSI" is uh, on Thursday at nine o'clock on CBS, and everybody in the audience is getting, uh, a copy of the third season on DVD. That's right. Oh, they're happy. The big finish is next, don't go away.
