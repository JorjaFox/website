Yesterday Jorja was at the The Guibord Center’s <a href="https://theguibordcenter.org/about/funding/annual-fundraising-dinner/fundraising-dinner-2018/">Fundraising Dinner</a> with Tim Phillips and other members and associates from Lion Ark. As Tim says:
<blockquote>Some of my favourite people at The Guibord Center event tonight. Patty Shenker, Jorja Fox, Jan, and Gwynne Guibord and Lo Sprague. An amazing night. A huge audience eating an amazing vegan meal - many for the first time I suspect. And sitting captivated as leading figures from 12 different religions spoke one after the other saying it was time to defend animals.</blockquote>
