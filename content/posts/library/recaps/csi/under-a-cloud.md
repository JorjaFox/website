## Synopsis

During a torrential downpour, Sara pulls the case of a man pulled out of a flood channel with a 'suspicious' head injury. While he's alive, they treat it like a crime scene, and Sara is at the hospital when he arrives. While the ER staff works on the patient, Sara begins to go through his belongings, only to find a bomb in his backpack. As she announces this to the crowded ER, the power (which had been flickering all across Las Vegas due to the storm) goes out.

The bomb is safely disposed of, however the man, who is still alive, has a fake ID. His fingerprints match someone in Atlanta GA, who is very much not him, so they put his face on the news, hoping for good luck. Back at the lab, Sara and Morgan look into the bomber's possible targets, and come up with three casinos. When the bomber comes too, he's speaking Armenian. Doc Robbins suspects it's because of the head injury, and is a type of amnesia.

The bomber is recognized on the news by the manager of the motel where he rented a room. However before the CSIs get there, the room is tossed, presumably by his associates. They are able to find his passport, however, naming him Arman Agakian. Alas, while Sara is learning that Agakian likely *removed* the bomb and did not plant it, Mr. Agakian dies mysteriously, and David Phillips is barred from picking him up by the FBI.

The USB drive Sara and Morgan Brody found in the hotel room, which is filled with information about the bomb placement, but curiously David Hodges and Henry determine the bomb was never actually meant to go off. This comes to a head when Sara runs into the FBI in D.B. Russell's office. Agakian was an undercover FBI agent, working to infiltrate the Armenian mob. He was planting dud bombs, which the FBI would then find and publicly announce were very well made. Oh, and he wasn't dead at all.

Meanwhile, Greg is served regarding a case from 2006, for which new evidence came to light, exonerating the convicted. However Greg is accused of planting evidence. Finn works with the defense criminalist to clear his name.

## Review

While Greg is on his way back from his case, Sara calls and asks him to pick up a veggie burger from AJs for herself and Morgan Brody. Sadly, before Greg arrives, she heads off on her case.

While holding the bomb, Sara is clearly terrified and shaking, but she holds as still as possible. Once the bomb is wheeled out, her legs give way and she falls into a seat on the nearby gurney. She does not loose her cool, and remembers to tell the bomb tech she'll need the pieces for evidence.

When Sara finds out Greg is under review, she comes to talk to him and see how he's doing. While Grissom was Greg's teacher, Sara was very much his mentor. While she has to return to her case, Sara makes the time to drive to Parumph and pick up Greg's favorite pastries to try and cheer him up.

## Notes

* Sara is still a vegetarian.
* Sara looses her appetite when facing death.
* When Morgan is stumped as to the USB's password, Sara comes up with the solution.
* Sara still hates having to hand over cases.
