It's all over the news and everyone seems to be excited about Jorja's return.

From <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007290.html?categoryid=14&cs=1">Variety</a>:
<blockquote>"CSI" too could benefit from having auds stick around for "The Mentalist." The show also gets an early-season jolt with the return of former cast fave Jorja Fox, and a Laurence Fishburne crossover planned for all three editions of the "CSI" franchise is a good way to get auds more invested in the mothership's new lead.</blockquote>

In the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/08/15/2009-08-15_jorja_fox_gets_turn_in_orange_jumpsuit_as_felonious_on_diva.html">NY Daily News</a>, Jorja said:
<blockquote>"I've had dreams of doing some type of a romantic comedy for years," she said. "William Petersen [who played 'CSI's' Gil Grissom] and myself, we drew on that as often as possible, but 'CSI' isn't really the right genre for romantic comedy." </blockquote>

And she told the <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/tv-radio/story/1599029.html">Fresno Bee</a>:
<blockquote>"My feet were pretty heavy [when I left CSI] and the last thing I wanted was the audience to sense that. Even when I left, I knew I would love to go back and visit the role," Fox says. "So when I decided to go back it was easy to put the vest back on." </blockquote>

Oh, plus bonus pictures from "Dead Doll"
