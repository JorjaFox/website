In CSI she's the ice cool utterly dedicated slightly grungy Sara Sidle but in real life Jorja Fox, 37, is far warmer with a passion for Blighty and in particular London. Revealing her anglophile leanings, she tells TV plus "I love London, it's great I'm loving the walking thing and the street energy of London the diversity and most of the people are really educated, cool and hip.

CSI's Jorja Fox is passionate about Britain and in particular the beer. "In London, you know what I really love is sitting in a pub drinking beer a huge pint" laughs the New York born star. In London she enjoys certain anonymity but she's not adverse to some of the trappings of fame that CSI brings. "I've gotten better tables in restaurants and wait in line less which is always really wonderful; people have been really friendly."

Jorja Fox is currently between series in CSI and is using her free time to produce a play in London. Having had success in 2004 with rock musical *Dear Bernard*, she's bringing it to the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith. "I'm thrilled that we've been invited, but it's also really scary. We'll just have to see what happens." The trip to London to work in theatre is a rare burst of activity for Jorja during time out from being knee deep in death in CSI. "All I usually want to do is go see Disney movies and comedies anything that's not about death". "I'm really into silly, stupid, shallow activities I really love to go surfing, go barefoot and try to wear as few clothes as possible.

Apart from padding around barely dressed JF's other great passion is animals. While the actress is guarded about her love life, she's happy to talk about the menagerie she has at her LA home. "I have a boxer dog, Ali, and 50 fish in my backyard. The fish came with the house and I was going to replace them with a jacuzzi but after 2 weeks I fell in love with them.

Jorja's passion for animals goes beyond keeping an ark full of pets; she's a keen supporter of militant animal rights group PETA. Jorja has also long been a vegetarian, and is understood to have converted CSI co-star William Petersen. In career terms CSI's Jorja Fox has scaled the heights starring in one of the planets most popular shows. Has she ambitions beyond such an amazing accolade "Sadly I've never known where I've been headed, I just end up somewhere".
