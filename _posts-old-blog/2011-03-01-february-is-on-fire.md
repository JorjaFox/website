This was pretty much a crazy month, almost as much as last February was.  What is it about February that does this?

<h2>CSI</h2>

Oh... you know what? You know what happened in February for <em>CSI</em>.

In April we'll get <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/lady-heather-returns-to-csi/">Lady Heather</a>.

<h2>News</h2>
All the news articles are up on the JorjaPedia: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/News_Articles_(2011)#February">News Articles (2011) - February</a>.  It's easier that way for everyone.

But besides that, Kristen Holly Smith's <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/dusty-springfield-at-joes-pub/">Dusty Springfield will be at Joe's Pub in March</a>, for one night only!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/pets-in-the-city-rip-ali/">Jorja gave an interview about her work with ADI, and mentioned that her Boxer, Ali, passed away in January.</a>

They also released <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/3-weeks-to-daytona-teaser-redux/">another clip of "3 Weeks to Daytona"</a>.

<h2>Operation: Lion Ark</h2>
The ADI has rescued more lions, and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/spring-fundraiser-operation-lion-ark/">JAA is raising money to help them out</a>!  Of course that wily Ms. Fox had to one-up us and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/jorja-on-hand-for-operation-lion-ark/">decided to go to Denver for the delivery of 25 more lions</a> (this time with Bob Barker).  When the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/the-lion-ark-has-landed/">Lion Ark Landed</a>, @AnimalDefenders shared news and photos.  The news media chipped in with <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/operation-lion-ark-videos/">videos</a> too! Jorja and Bob even went to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/adi-and-issues-with-jane-velez-mitchell/">Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell</a> to talk about it.

For this, JAA is running a  <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/lionark/fundraiser/jorjafoxonline">Crowdrise: LionArk Fundraiser</a>.  After all, Jorja helped fund getting the lions out of Bolivia, the least we can do is help pay for the $8000/year per lion to keep them healthy and safe.

<h2>JFO news</h2>
Things are running faster now.  The stress test of "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" let me sort out where and why some slowdowns were occurring.

You may notice some new posts showing up without titles, links, or anything more than quick 'content'.  Kind of like tweets, right?
<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/03/example-aside.jpg" alt="" title="example-aside" width="611" height="71" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3121" />
These are 'asides' and are meant for short notes that don't really need a full blog post.  I'm going to use them sparingly, as they don't allow for comments (this is by MY design).  The goal is quick alerts that will either later become major posts, or stay just things you may want to know.

Also, for those of you who use Twitter, the new grey bar at the top of the screen has a hidden surprise.  The **Shortlink** button takes you to a shorter version of the page URL, which you can then use in Tweets without running out of space.
