*Sharks are more important to our lives than we may imagine. It is time for us to appreciate their significance. We are grateful for the amazing job they do, every day, in all the oceans around the world to keep fish stock and the ocean healthy and vibrant.*

Thank you, sharks, for making us feel awe and wonder, for connecting us to the wild, for being a fierce predator but not seeing us as prey.

Forgive us, sharks, for our ignorance, for making you a monster, for hunting you to extinction, for destroying your home.

What you do for us, for the ocean, for the planet -- no other species, no amount of money, no human invention can replace.

The ocean needs you, we need you. We all must thank you.
