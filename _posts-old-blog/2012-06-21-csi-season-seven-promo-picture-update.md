And now I'm just showing off.

Photos of the shaving are really a hoot, personally. And it's weird, but some of the photos they took for Season six became the ones they used in season seven's 'Keppler' promos.

That always messed me up when organizing. The photos clearly were at the same set as season 6 (the backgrounds matched) but the tan shirt Jorja wore was clearly the same here! Devon mentioned that they were being really subtle in season six. I think having the shoots be the 'same' were really what made it work. And knowing that everyone was photographed separately is even neater. That means they intended always to have Sara and Grissom that close.

Heh.
