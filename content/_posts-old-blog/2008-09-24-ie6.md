19% of the users who come to JFO are using Internet Explorer 6 or earlier, and when I'm at work, I'm one of them.  From this day forward, JFO will not be designed to look correct on those browsers.  IE 6 came out in 2001 and hasn't been updated since 2004.  In four years, webdesign has moved forward and I'm tired of coding in silly format workarounds to make the site look passable on something that out of date.

If you can't upgrade to IE 7, use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, or <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> (but not Safari for Windows).
