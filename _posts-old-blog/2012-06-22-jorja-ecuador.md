Thanks to Lanos for spotting this one!

Jorja was in Ecuador again. From the news page of the hotel:
<blockquote>**CSI actress Jorja Fox**

Several weeks ago, CSI actress Jorja Fox, visited Ecuador to explore further her passion in animal rights and the conservation of the environment. During her time in Ecuador, Ms Fox visited the Ecuadorian capital of Quito, located in the Avenue of the Volcanoes and the Galapagos Islands.

Whilst in Quito she stayed with us in Boutique Hotel Café Cultura and it was a real pleasure for us to look after her. She expressed delight in knowing that the constitution of Ecuador recognizes the rights of nature and commented on how well preserved the areas that she visited were.</blockquote>
