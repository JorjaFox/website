The CSI Producer discusses the big crossover, what's coming up in the remaining sweeps episodes of "CSI" and the return of a memorable nemesis. Lights spoilers inside!

November sweeps has already seen the historic first three CSI show crossover, but there's more excitement to come, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" Producer "Allen MacDonald" promises. In addition to teasing the episode he's at work on now-which brings back a familiar face-MacDonald discusses the return of Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**), the departure of **Lauren Lee Smith** and Nick Stokes' (**George Eads**) promotion.

[...]

**CSI Files:** Sara Sidle sure is spending a lot of time away from her new husband! Are we meant to read anything into that?

**MacDonald:** I think it's always been clear Grissom and Sara would have a non-traditional approach to marriage.

**CSI Files:** What was behind the decision to have Sara and Grissom marry?

**MacDonald:** We felt it was a natural conclusion to where we left them both at the end of "One to Go" in the rainforest of Costa Rica.

[...]

**CSI Files:** Are you at work on a new episode now? Can you hint at what it might be about?

**MacDonald:** I am. And the only hint I can provide is that it would be the completion of a CSI storyline trilogy involving Sara Sidle and a very, very smart young girl.
