As I've mentioned before, Jorja helped produce a film called <a href="http://extinctionsoupmovie.com">Extinction Soup</a>. Â It aired in Palm Springs at the <a href="http://www.americandocumentaryfilmfestival.com/">AmDocs Film Festival</a> over the weekend (which was earthquake free, unlike where I live) and Jorja was there.

She must have sprinted from filming on Friday! I'll post more pictures as they show up in the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/filmfest/20140330-amdocsff">AmDocs Film Festival Gallery</a>
