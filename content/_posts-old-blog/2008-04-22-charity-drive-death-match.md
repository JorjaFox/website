Since we seem to be pro-animal this year, I've split the votes for either fundforanimals.org or animalacres.org (who had an astounding 50+ email votes! Yipes!).  Winner takes all. Voting closes on the 30th of April, but donations will be open until July 1st, 2008.

Donations are now open! 

Sadly due to US tax laws, I need everyone to use paypal this year. I know that crimps the students, and I do apologize, but my taxes were a mess this year and this is the simplest way for me to sort it out and avoid another audit. On the plus side, I have a merchant account with Paypal, which means a lot more security.  I know a lot of people complain about Paypal, but I've been a member for 7 years and never had a problem.
