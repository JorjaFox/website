<blockquote>**The Murder of a 14 Year Old Has Ties to the Past on 'CSI'**

From <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/CSI-Dr-Jekyll-1016161.aspx">TV Guide</a>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, the rest of the team links a young boy's murder to an old case. "Part of the story deals with a case that Sara (Jorja Fox) handled before leaving for Costa Rica. It was one of the things that kind of frustrated her to the point of wanting to leave," Mularz says, adding that it's interesting for Langston to see someone share his passion about closing a case. "Langston, who joined the team after that, has really only known her as Mrs. Grissom. So he gets a glimpse of the fire that still lingers around some of these cases in her mind."</blockquote>

Updated at 10:45pm ET.  This was a good episode, not great, but good. Sara gets it four stars, but really more like 3.5.
