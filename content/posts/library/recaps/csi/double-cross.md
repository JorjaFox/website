## Synopsis

Singer Charlotte Danville is murdered, crucified above a statue of Jesus in a church, killed by Cody, owner of Hombre Motors. Frank Berlin (now Father Frank of the church in question) and Charlotte had been high school sweethearts, but had split up before prom, with her attending with her other best friend Cody. Years later, Cody uses his car dealership to help fund Father Frank's church, while providing a car and condo for Charlotte. Cody loves Charlotte, but she was pregnant and in love with Frank. Frank, who had left her years ago for the priesthood, had recently realized he loved her more than he loved being a priest, and had arranged to leave his vocation in order to marry her and raise her child, even if it wasn't his. Both a novice nun and Father Frank try and confess for the crime, but it's Cody, the Big Hombre, who killed Charlotte and her child, who was also Cody's child.

## Review

Sara processes the body and finds bougainvillea stuck in the body's foot. She expresses her views of God and religion to Grissom, and fears she offended him, as he is a non-practicing Catholic.

## Notes

* Sara is agnostic.

**Sara:** I'm not an atheist, but I am _not_ sold on the idea of a higher power.

**Sara:** Sometimes ... I think we made up God just to have someone to blame for our mistakes. _(Grissom turns and leaves the morgue, and Sara calls after him.)_ It's just a theory.
