This was 1993, when we really didn't know anything about AIDS (like that you couldn't get it just by hanging around someone with AIDS).  Connie has to find the woman, face down her boyfriend's parents (who are in denial about their son having had AIDS), and reconcile her with her own parents.  It'll make you cry.  So here are two clips from "I Can't Even Imagine" and the screencaps as well.
