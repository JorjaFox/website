## Synopsis

A young boy runs away from home, returning to take his little brother with him, after his potential stepfather steals from their home and blames it on him, and then threatens his life. Connie has to trace the family of an heroic John Doe who saved a little girl's life, in order to find out what his medical problems are, and along the way feels some chemistry with the surgeon.

## Review

Dr. Eric Varga calls in a missing person in the case of a John Doe who had an allergic reaction in the middle of emergency surgery. They need to find who he is so they can find his medical records and save his life. His legs were run over by a car after he jumped in front of it to push a little girl aside. By tracking the bags pulled off of planes (due to unclaimed boarding passes), they find the John Doe is named Kevin Sullivan and is allergic to just about everything.

When Connie goes to follow up on Mr. Sullivan, Dr. Varga asks if her ring is decorative or functional, and is quite happy to learn it's a fashion statement. Connie spends the night at the hospital to be sure everything turns out alright, and accepts a date with Dr. Varga.

## Notes

* Connie accepts a date with Dr. Varga.

## Quotes

**Dr. Varga:** You know, when I get up, I'm probably gonna be hungry. And I hate to eat alone.
**Connie:** Okay, I'll meet you. But you're paying for dinner, I bought the coffee.
