On Thursday, we had double the normal number of individual visitors, everyone stayed on the site three times as long, causing the number of pageviews to nearly quadruple.  Then on Friday, as things drifted back to high, but more normal, our YouTube channel rocketed to over 2000 views, making us #42 for 'Most Viewed Channel.'

I guess y'all like the site. So from me, Ipstenu, to all of you, thanks.  I hope that, even with Jorja's time on _CSI_ at an end, you find something to keep you coming back for more.  I have no idea where we'll all be next year, or what Jorja will do, but I plan to be right here at JFO.
