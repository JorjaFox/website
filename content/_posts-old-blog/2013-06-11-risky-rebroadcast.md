<blockquote>"Risky Business Class" — When five people are killed in a small plane crash a mile off the Vegas strip, the CSI team is called to investigate.  Also, Sara feels the strain of having a long-distance relationship with Grissom when a former lover of hers is involved with the crash investigation, on a rebroadcast of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, June 12 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. (Originally broadcast 12/12/12.)</blockquote>
It's a rebroadcast, but if you're going to pick a CSI episode to watch this summer, this should be on your list! Personally I will rewatch it, since it's nice to watch while not having to screencap and recap!

Hard to say, Doug. Hard to say.
