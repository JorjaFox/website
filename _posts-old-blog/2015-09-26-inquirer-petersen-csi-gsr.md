<blockquote>How will the “CSI” special two-hour series finale address the romance between William Petersen’s Gil Grissom and Jorja Fox’s Sara Sidle?

...

**Will there be closure for Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle?**

You have to watch. I don’t know how they edited it so who knows?

They are teasing a lot about it in the trailer.

Of course, they are. I am always leery of saying much about it. With the technology and everything, everybody is going to find out anyway. But yeah, a big part of the finale is what happens to those guys (Gil and Sara).
