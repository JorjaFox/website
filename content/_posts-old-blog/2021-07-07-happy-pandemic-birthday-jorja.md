<p>Another year has gone by, and this year we're all looking forward to <em>CSI: Vegas</em>. We still don't know a lot, but likely Jorja's busy working on her birthday to get the series finished and wrapped.</p>

<p>Hopefully she gets some time off to enjoy the nice weather (seriously, it's really nice right now in SoCal) and catch some waves.</p>

<p>See you on the small screen soon, Jorja!</p>
