There was a lot going on today!

<h2>The Talk</h2>

Today Jorja was with Paula Newsome (Maxine Roby, head of the lab) on _The Talk_ to talk about ... _CSI: Vegas_! We have some official photos for you.

You can watch the interview right now on <a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/1242493/1154423/3065">Paramount+</a> or tomorrow on cbs.com for free. Here are some highlights:

<ul><li>Jorja repeated her explanation of how Jerry Bruckheimer asked her and Billy to do 'something' for the 20th anniversary of _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ and it morphed into this.</li><li>She reiterated how lucky she and Billy were to get an ending at all, let alone a happy one.</li><li>Jorja (and Paula) are happy about seeing so many women in the field now, which is the opposite from when the series began.</li><li>_CSI: Vegas_ is more reflective of real life (with science and casting) than it was before.</li><li>The science has changed so much since 2000! 20 years of new science!</li><li>Jorja felt at home in the lab, but she's more comfortable with the practical side of science.</li><li>Jorja would love a musical episode, but can't sing, so would be playing drums.</li></ul>

<h2>Chicago Tribune Article</h2>

Jorja gave a very candid interview with Nina Metz from the Chicago Tribune about the time she was asked to sign an NDA/gag order, and did so. She has come to regret that moment, but all things considered, I cannot fault her choice there. No matter how you come to it, NDAs and gag orders are incredibly difficult to address and many times you will feel like there's no right decision.
