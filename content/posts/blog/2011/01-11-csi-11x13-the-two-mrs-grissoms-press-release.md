We have an airdate and the plot is exactly what our CSI spy told us.  So remember to thank the spy and trust her (him?).  We've yet to be lead astray!

<blockquote>"The Two Mrs. Grissoms" - A night full of celebration ends with a bang when the director of a scholarship foundation for the deaf is killed by a deadly car bomb, prompting Sara to interrogate the students and faculty of the college where her mother-in-law works, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, Feb. 3 (9:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.  Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin ("Children of a Lesser God," "The L Word") guest stars as a deaf professor and Grissom's ex-girlfriend, Julia Holden.  Phyllis Frelich ("Santa Barbara") guest stars as Grissom's deaf mother/Sara's mother-in-law.</blockquote>
