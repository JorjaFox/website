<h3>Unofficial Release</h3>
When Catherine works with the FBI again after a professional hit occurs at a law firm she recommended to her friend, Laura (remember her with the mogul husband, Mark, who has a lot to hide behind his successful corporation?), the CSI team identifies shocking similarities at the crime scene. Did Mark hire the hit men to kill his own wife?
