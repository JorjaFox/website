'CSI' STARS FIRED AFTER PAY REQUESTS

Hit TV show "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" is in crisis after two stars of the series were fired for breach of contract.

Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads - who play detectives Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes respectively - were axed from the show after demanding a bigger pay package.

The pair's publicist Danica Smith confirmed Fox was fired on Wednesday, but did not have details on whether Eads' was fired.

However, reports claim Eads did not show up for work Thursday, the first day of production for the next season.

The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts, but asked for more money to keep them attached to the TV hit.

Though a search was underway for their replacements, it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones.

Despite the major blow for the show, "CSI" picked up four Emmy nominations Thursday, including one for best drama series.
