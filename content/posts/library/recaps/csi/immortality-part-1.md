## Synopsis

We start with a 'normal' episode of CSI. Finn is dead, D.B. Russell is leaving to work for the CSI: Cyber people, Sara is applying for a 'key position' And then it all goes to hell with a suicide bomber.

We find Grissom working on a boat in San Diego, helping catch people illegally trapping sharks for shark fin soup. The CSIs that show up don't mention Nick, who is their head last we heard.

While Grissom is arrested for illegal trespassing, Catherine shows up from Quanitco and wants in. DB and Sara try to keep her off the case, but it's Catherine. When they find evidence pointing to Lady Heather, it's Conrad Ecklie who has the brass balls to ask Sara for Grissom's number. This gets Grissom out of hot water with San Diego at least.

When Grissom shows up in Vegas, he's accosted by Lindsey Willows, Catherine's daughter, a new level 1 CSI, starting her first day. It's deja vu all over again. Grissom isn't any less discombobulated when he sees Sara.

At Heather's house they find evidence of bomb making, which doesn't make anyone happy. Sara and Brass chase down a woman on the grounds, believing it to be Heather, but she blows up and injures Brass enough that he's sent to the hospital.

And the woman? Isn't Heather. Alive and well, Heather comes to the lab and turns herself in, saying she's the one behind the bombings.

_The episode concludes with [Immortality (Part 2)](/library/recaps/csi/immortality-part-2/)_

## Review

While she's moved on with her life and is trying to professionally make it through, Sara is not happy about Grissom and Heather, and really who can blame her? She kept Grissom's number but they hadn't been talking, even before the divorce, to the point that she didn't know he was talking to Heather.

## Notes

* Sara and Grissom are divorced
* Communication issues led to the divorce
* Sara is applying for lab director

## Quotes

**Sara** Look, we both went our separate ways. You're doing your Jacques Cousteau thing. I'm out in the field. Things end. I get it. But you and I are professionals. And as professionals, I think it's in the best interest of my case to put our game faces on... and keep it... professional... See... Mine's on. Ready to go in?\
**Grissom** Seeing you again left me speechless.
