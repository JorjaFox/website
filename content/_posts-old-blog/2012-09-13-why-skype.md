In Spain, they're just now getting Season 11. FormulaTV talked to Jorja about the season that brought us "House of Hoarders" and, of course, "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" (which is still one of my favorite titles, I'm partial to puns like "To Halve and to Hold"). Of course it's in Spanish.

I apologize for my lousy translation skills, I haven't yet cleaned it up.
<blockquote><strong>Why did Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom used Skype to communicate?</strong>

There was an episode where Grissom Sara sent a video message by email, essentially to break with him from Shepard sea, off the coast of Galapagos Islands. We believed that this was the appropriate way Grissom and Sara had to report regularly. After that, he was in a jungle in Costa Rica, which is great.</blockquote>
