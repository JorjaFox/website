Congress is back in session, and Jorja's headed to the Hill on November 2nd to take on animal cruelty!

For those of you who are lost, Capitol Hill is a metonym for the United States Congress.  Basically if you hear someone say 'Capitol Hill' or 'The Hill' what they mean is the US Congress.  So 'going to the Hill' means someone's going to Congress for one reason or another.  Jorja and Bob will be telling Congress why they need to be better people.  Which is pretty bad ass.
