**How it was the experience working in a chapter of a prime time TV show CSI with Academy Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin or TV stars like Jorja Fox?**

It was truly wonderful. Marlee is a genius, I was so jealous watching her work. Because it was a deaf themed episode (The Two Mrs. Grissoms) we had tons of deaf actors, including Phyllis Frelich, who won the Tony for the same role, Marlee won the Oscar (Sarah in "Children of a Lesser God", Phyllis on Broadway and Marlee in the film). They were both very friendly and just stunning to watch work. The entire CSI cast and crew were very welcoming and very professional. They've been doing it so long that they run like a well-oiled machine, and everyone gets along, which is important in a creative environment. Jorja herself was an absolute sweetheart. She had to learn sign language for that episode, and she was working extremely hard to make sure she got it right. I hope I get to work with her again.

**In CSI you played a very interesting role who finally turns being the killer, it was your first time performing a villain, do you feel comfortable doing that character or do you prefer the hero or a leading role?**

I've played the villain before, and it's by far my favorite role. I find them far more interesting to play and really fun - when else can you be the bad guy and have no consequences?
