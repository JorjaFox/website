I have to tell you, I watched this and it's a little horrible to me to see how they all shout her name and ask her to turn around and... Yech! Poor Jorja.

Can't see the video, I have <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/awards/sc/20140126-grammys/">fifty screencaps</a> and while you look at them, have someone stand behind you and shout "Jorja! Jorja! Look here! Smile! Ms. Fox! Jorja Fox! Jorja! Turn! Your hair, can you fix it?" and the in the middle reply "Now I have to start over!", laugh, and then carry on with them shouting at you.

Or, you know, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/awards/sc/20140126-grammys/maximotv/">just look at the screencaps</a>.

I'm not entering. Couldn't pay me enough to deal with that!
