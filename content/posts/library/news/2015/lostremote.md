While CSI has been one of the longest-running shows of the decade, its series finale drew almost no digital buzz. Amobee Brand Intelligence analyzed the engagements around the finale and found that just a few fans were called to action last night, which either means that CSI is more a of a VOD hit than anything else or that everyone was watching ABC, which premiered Quantico and Once Upon a Time last night.

Most interest spun around original cast members returning for the finale. Between Sept. 27-28, **William Petersen**, who hadn't been a series regular since season 9 had the most CSI related digital content engagement; while **Marg Helgenberger** who hadn't been a series lead since season 12, had 81 percent as much CSI related digital content engagement. **Ted Danson**, who'd been on the show between seasons 12-15 had 74 percent as much CSI related digital content engagement as Peterson between Sept. 27-28; with **Jorja Fox** who'd been with the show for every season other than seasons 9-10; having 54 percent as much CSI related digital content engagement as Peterson in the same time period.
