Massive props to @shirlthewhirl for finding this video.

Includes an in depth look into the GSR relationship and the filming of Grissom's return "Grissom - Sara corridor scene" from Law of Gravity.   Also all about that famous scene where Grissom and Sara's relationship is 'outed' to everyone.

So there we are then.  It's a pretty cool to finally find that scrap of tape!

I think, in retrospect, while I've never been for or against GSR, I like the way it played out.  I'm satisfied with the way they told the story, the way it was revealed, and even the way it continues to be told.  It feels true to the characters. They are an unconventional love story, and it remains that way to this day!
