From <a href="http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/27356/20141011/csi-season-15-news-spoilers-will-someone-die-sara-and-greg-quarantined-after-exposure-to-deadly-pathogen-video.htm">The Eye at Fashion and Style</a>:
<blockquote>No one escapes alive.

At least, that's what the promo for Sunday's episode of **"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"** would have us believe. In the preview for 'Bad Blood', Sara (**Jorja Fox**) and Greg (**Eric Szmanda**) aren't looking so hot â€” and it's no wonder, as, while investigating a crime scene, they're exposed to a deadly virus with a crushing fatality rate of 80%.

From the looks of it, the virus hits one of the pair harder than the other. At one point in the promo, we see a pale, sweaty Sara collapse to the floor while Greg looks on helplessly.

Unfortunately, Russell (_Ted Danson_) doesn't have much time to worry about his friends and co-workers, since the pathogen ended up on planes headed to four different continents. Still, that doesn't stop a concerned Russell from giving the pair direct orders not to die.

The official synopsis for 'Bad Blood' reads:

_Sara and Greg are quarantined after responding to a crime scene that's contaminated with a deadly pathogen._</blockquote>
