## Synopsis

The miniature serial killer is revealed to be Natalie Davis, foster daughter to Ernie Dell , who has an aversion to bleach. Having killed some of her foster siblings, including Trevor just 12 days ago, she caps her crime spree by abducting and trapping Sara under a car.

Natalie's story is told with many flashbacks to how she got the job cleaning the CSI lab, as well as that Ernie knew she was killing. Natalie's issues with bleach began when she killed her birth sister, shoving her out of their tree house, and her father cleaned up the blood with bleach. Unable to care for her, he gave Natalie up to social services. Having seen both Grissom's miniature and his affection for Sara, Natalie makes Sara her final victim as payback. Because Natalie blames Grissom for Ernie's death, and Ernie was the only person who she ever loved, Natalie tries to make Grissom suffer like she did.

She leaves a miniature of Sara, trapped under a car, but still moving, in Grissom's office. After Natalie is brought in for questioning, she refuses to tell Grissom where Sara is.

## Review

Sara works the Trevor Dell case, helping Grissom connect it to the miniature crime-scenes. She is attacked and tazered by Natalie outside her car and abducted. The episode ends with Sara trapped under a wrecked car out in the desert, with one hand reaching into the muddy ground.

## Notes

* Sara is comfortable about being called 'my dear'
* The team discover that Grissom and Sara are involved in a relationship

## Quotes

**Grissom:** I took away the only person that she ever loved, so she's going to do the same thing to me.
