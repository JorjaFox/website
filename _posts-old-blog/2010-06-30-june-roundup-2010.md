<h2>JFO News</h2>
<a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/june-roundup-2010/june/" rel="attachment wp-att-2486"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/06/june-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="june" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2486" /></a> Why is this first this month? Well.  Ads.

I know you all hate them, and so do I, but they bring in $15 to $30 a month, which really helps cover a site that costs between $30 and $60 a month (USD).  But I have an idea for you.  Rather than let you buy an 'ad free' site for yourself, I'd like to pitch this idea. For $6, you can remove any one ad from the site for 30 days.  For everyone.  Across the whole site.  Right now the whole process is manual via PayPal, so there may be some glitches as I sort out how to get it working perfectly from my end.

Why $6? Well, paypal takes a hit off any money you send, and this actually works out to me getting $5.55 USD from US accounts and $5.50 from non US accounts, give or take a penny.

How do you do this?  Click the 'Pay Now' link and tell me which ad you want to replace. If you don't specify, the first to go will be Amazon, then Google, then Project Wonderful (I like them the best, since they're community driven and many of the people who buy those ads are Jorja fans!).
<div style="text-align:center"><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"/>
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="BESBF5S8H36PW"/>
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_paynow_SM.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!"/>
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"/>
</form></div>

If this works well, you won't see ads!  If not, well hopefully you'll see _fewer_ ads.  I'll be adding a link to the Ad Free page across the site shortly, so don't worry about forgetting the link.

<h3>Reporting Posts</h3>
You may notice there are links below each comment for you to 'Flag this comment as inappropriate.' Flag comments and I'll review them and either delete them or approve them. Note that when you flag a comment, _your_ username is logged. This is to prevent people from being idiots about the whole thing, and only logged in, registered users can flag a comment. If I catch you abusing the system, you'll be banned. This is your only warning. If you can't play nice, you can't play here.

I was sampling out a couple different types of ways to do this, and right away some brain-trust clicked on every single link. I suspect it was actually a bot and not a person, so the changes made were to use a BuddyPress plugin that covers the whole site, and to restrict it to logged in users.  Now that said, a logged in user can flag an 'anonymous' user, so don't think you're getting off scott free.  Just behave, is all I ask.

<h3>Birthday Fundraiser</h3>
For Jorja's birthday, JFO's raising money to clean up the oil spill.  For more information, hit up <a href="https://jorjafox.net/birthday/">https://jorjafox.net/birthday/</a> - I'll be accepting donations until September.

<h2>Jorja News</h2>
<h3>Advocacy</h3>
Jorja ended up not attending the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-may-not-attend-the-hsus-winery-event/">HSUS Event at the Jordan Winery</a>.  There's been some speculation as to why, but likely it has to do with issues between the winery at the Humane Society.  In the end, money was raised for a good cause, so there's no real loss.

Of course, more news trickled in about the fantastic Lion Rescue from May, and we got <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/flickr-flight-to-freedom/">more photos</a> of Jorja at that amazing event, as well as a trip to talk to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-on-issues-with-jane-velez-mitchell/">ISSUES with Jane Velez-Mitchell</a> on CNN.

Then Jorja put her weight behind <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/idaez2010-announcement/">International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos (IDAEZ)</a> to help get elephants out of zoos, where they don't have enough room.

Alas, she did not win the PETA's sexiest vegetarian (that went to _House_'s Olivia Wilde).

<h3>Emmys</h3>
Jorja put her name in the ring again for the Emmys with the _CSI _episode "Unshockable" (which had that adorable Grissom/Canoe mention moment).  If you tweet, don't forget to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010-emmy-ballots-consider-jorja/">#considerjorja</a> for that Emmy!

<h3>CBS Shananigans</h3>
After CBS fired one of the female leads off _Criminal Minds_ and hacked the episode count for another, the media was abuzz wondering if this was just the way of TV's sexism, and if so, was it related to the treatment of Jorja, back when she was fired.  I asked you <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-departure-endemic-of-tv/">Was Jorja's 2007 CSI Departure Endemic of TV?</a>  While none of us are media lawyers, I think the different views of how women are portrayed and treated on TV was interesting.

<h3>Is she coming back?</h3>
I still have to say 'No idea.'  Probably? Possibly? Maybe?  We'll probably know by the end of July. Sorry folks. That's how CBS rolls this year.
