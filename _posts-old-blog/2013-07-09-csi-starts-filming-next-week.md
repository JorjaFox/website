I know absolutely nothing about CSI's next season, except that I _do_ know that Jorja is in the premiere.

What would you like to see addressed in the premiere? Keep in mind it's pretty much going to be the Morgan Show, so unless we find out something wild, like Morgan is actually Brass' daughter and Ellie is Ecklie's, and Ellie is also one of Sara's former foster siblings...

Actually I'd watch that.

Remember, CSI begins its 14th season Wednesday, Sept. 25th.
