_I Love the 70s_ takes viewers on another fun-filled ride through the music, movies, TV shows, products, fashions, fads, trends and major events that defined pop culture each year of the decade. From Star Wars to Charlie's Angels, leisure suits to underoos, mutton-chop sideburns to the Mod Squad... we once again tap our collective memories to cover the sublime, the ridiculous, and everything in between. 

Comics, rock stars, actors, writers and other celebs past and present weigh in on the 70s experience. They discuss the important questions of the decade: What the hell happened to Richie's brother Chuck on Happy Days? Did Michael Myers use Ginsu knives in Halloween? And most important of all: Who sank my Battleship? 

Viewers are treated to a barrage of retro clips from sitcoms, movies, network news, commercials and other sources. And it won't be just TV, music and film. It's be cars, junk food, fashion and everything else that went into making the delicious pop culture stew that was the 70s.
