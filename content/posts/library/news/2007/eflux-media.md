"Goodbye and Good Luck" was Jorja Fox's last appearance on the popular CBS series "CSI," after a seven-year tenure on the show.

Forensic scientist Sara Sidle, the character Fox had portrayed since 2000, was very popular with fans - so much so that, when the actress was fired in 2004. It was a temporary dismissal, as the public reacted strongly, demanding that she return.

Thursday night's episode was the last Fox filmed as Sara Sidle and a worthy farewell for a notable character. Haunted by a suspect from a past case, the CSI ultimately decides to leave her harrowing job behind and sort out her emotional problems away from ever-present crime scenes.

The actress talked to Entertainment Weekly in October and clarified that her decision to leave the show had nothing to do with discontent over money or any such things.

"There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old," the 40-year-old actress said. "If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by. I have to get off the ride for a while."

Fox also revealed that CBS had invited her to stay for the eighth season but she did not wish to prolong her contract, choosing to do only a few more episodes.

The actress has also appeared in the NBC television series "ER," and "The West Wing." Her screen credits include "Memento," "Down with the Joneses" and "The Kill-Off."

According to a bio on CBS's website, Fox is co-founder of Honeypot Productions, an independent theater company in Los Angeles.
