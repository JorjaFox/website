I don't know, you try to make something witty and sometimes it just sucks...

Anyway, Jorja did some modeling for People Magazine back in 2003, most of which never made it to the magazine (which is normal). I've had some older, smaller, versions of the photos, but now here are two larger ones to enjoy.

Looking pretty nice and large. Have a nice smile.
