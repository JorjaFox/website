When the CSI team is called in to investigate a robbery-homicide at an “Alice In Wonderland”-themed wedding, they have little to work with to find a killer. Meanwhile, Hodges’ mother comes to town, and he wants her to believe Morgan is his girlfriend.

And this:
<blockquote><strong>CSI Files</strong>: There’s word that Gil Grissom will somehow factor into the episode. Will there be an appearance by<strong>William Petersen</strong> before the end of the season?

<strong>Pokaski</strong>: I can’t speak to the end of the season (or I might not make it past it myself), but part of Wednesday night’s story is dedicated to understanding Married life between Sara [Sidle, <strong>Jorja Fox</strong>] and Grissom. How it works, and why it works. And the last image in that sub-story makes me smile every time I see it.</blockquote>
