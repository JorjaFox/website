**Jorja Fox**

She's played a lesbian intern and a forensic investigator. But in her spare time, Jorja Fox is a bit of a surfer-babe.

We were strolling along the sandy shores of Venice Beach, LA, in search of hot surfer chicks when we bumped into rather famous actress and lesbian icon Jorja Fox, fresh from a wave-riding session.

You may know her as the firm but fair Sara Sidle from the popular TV crime series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation". As Sidle, Fox has won sofa-loads of fans for her uncompromising stance on protecting victims of domestic violence and for her ruthless practicality.

Fox also stared in "The West Wing" as Gina Toscano, a Secret Service agent in charge of protecting the President's teenage daughter. But it was as tough-talking lesbian medical intern Maggie Doyle in "ER" that Fox captured the hearts of dykes around the globe. Doyle was a smart, confident, gun-toting vegetarian feminist who challenged authority and revealed her sexuality to colleague Carter on a shooting range - because her ex-girlfriend, Amy, was there and was 'jealous as hell'. What a woman.

And her place is forever cemented in lesbian TV history for her appearance on the 'coming out' "Puppy" episode of "Ellen". Fox played the unnamed lesbian who walks up to Ellen in a cafe, sits next to her, and then chats up Ellen's best friend, Paige. Ellen sighs and says, 'Well, it's good to see some things never change'. **D**
