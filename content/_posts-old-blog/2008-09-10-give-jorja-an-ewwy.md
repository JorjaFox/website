EW.com is hosting the EWwy, for all our favorite stars who got shafted at the Emmys.  <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20045108_20045120_20224211_16,00.html">Jorja is nominated.</a>

<blockquote><strong>BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A DRAMA, NOMINEE #4</strong>
Jorja Fox, CSI

She was brilliant, and you felt the emotional pain that her character Sara Sidle was going through; that's more than I can say for any of the nominees from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, who only made me glad that none of them were really doctors." â€” Adrien</blockquote>
