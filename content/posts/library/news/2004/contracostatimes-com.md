Two dismissed "CSI"ers learned the hard way:

Everybody really does love "Raymond."

The firing of two "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" stars in a salary dispute was fair and intended to help the TV industry draw the fiscal line, CBS chief Les Moonves said Sunday.

Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes on the hit CBS crime drama, were dumped last week when they failed to report for work on the upcoming season, he said.

"There comes a point where we feel a contract is a contract. ... We all have to look out for the future of the network television business," he said.

Translation: "You think we won't be able to find young hotties willing to wield cotton swabs and squint at carpet fibers for half the price?"

Deals with Fox and Eads were renegotiated after two years and a raise was offered for this fifth season although there was no contractual obligation to do so, he said. The actors reportedly wanted a raise in their $100,000-per-episode pay.

Discussions had been under way with their lawyers and there were certain "veiled threats about their not showing up," Moonves said. They probably got the idea last year, when "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Brad Garrett successfully staged a salary walkout. Asked to compare the "CSI" actors' situation with that of the Emmy-winning Garrett, Moonves was vague.

"We did a negotiation, we brought him (Garrett) back into the fold," Moonves said. "We're very happy we did."

Translation: "He won an Emmy, for heaven's sake ... and he's big enough to stomp me into next week, so I signed the check."

A call seeking comment from the actors (surprise!) was not immediately returned Sunday by their publicist.

Production will be halted this week while script revisions are made, Moonves said. The roles played by Fox and Eads haven't been recast but the network is "looking at certain people," Moonves added.

Another cast member, Marg Helgenberger, reported to work as scheduled last week, he said. William Petersen, who co-stars and is a producer on the series, was on call for next week.

Asked if he was concerned about damage to one of TV's top-rated series, Moonves said, "Of course." Later, he said it was possible cast members Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle might play bigger roles.
