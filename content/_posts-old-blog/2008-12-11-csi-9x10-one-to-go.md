The press release for One To Go is out.

<blockquote>The CSI team is shocked and saddened when, after working with Dr. Raymond Langston on the "Dick & Jane" murders, Grissom announces that his time as a CSI has come to an end and offers Langston a permanent position on the CSI team</blockquote>

Please be aware, Jorja Fox <strong>is not</strong> listed in the cast list.  But she wasn't listed in <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20080515cbs11">Dead Doll</a> either.  I have it on very good, trustworthy, authority that she will be in this episode.  It's been filmed.  So unless they re-do the ending, we should see Sara one last time.

Breath :)
