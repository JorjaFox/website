I'm sure there will be more later. I've slept about six hours though and I have to get to work, so here you go!

## The News

From EW: <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/17/paleyfest-csi-panel-farewell-salute">5 things we learned at the _CSI_ farewell salute</a>

<blockquote>**2. This cast really loves each other …**

Rice asked the cast to go in a circle and each share their first impression of the person sitting to their right. Their answers ranged from sincere to sarcastic, but all spoke with deep affection for the people sitting around them. Danson called Helgenberger “the most elegant, gracious, and welcoming lady that I’ve worked with” before Helgenberger told Petersen, “I can’t imagine taking this ride with anybody else.”

Fox said to Guilfoyle, completely seriously, “You have this New York sensibility, and this wit, and [you’re] down-to-earth, and you took risks, and you were just so classy, and kind of Austin Powers.” Guilfoyle broke the rules and replied to her, calling Fox “the heart of this whole group.” Berman revealed that he officiated Wellner’s wedding and threw his bachelor party, adding, “To get to work with my best friend every single day is pretty amazing.” Wellner paid it forward to Szmanda: “He’s so dreamy!”

**3. … except Jorja Fox and William Petersen — at first**

Fox sat to Petersen’s right, and when his turn came to recall their first meeting, he turned to her and said, “Did we meet at lunch?” Rather than answering the question, Fox replied, “You drove me crazy.” For the first how many months? “Like six. And then, I don’t know … I realized we were kind of stuck together.”

Petersen was not evidently bothered by Fox’s admission. He fondly recollected their first lunch together and said, “Every time I was able to do a scene with you, it was like falling off a log. I think that Grissom fell for you because you got him. And you got me, too.” The audience aww-ed, and Fox amended, “I adore you so much.”</blockquote>

## The Gallery

It's up! It has a lot of images (including the few I took -- I told you I was shitty at that). Click on the big picture of Jorja to go straight there. I'll be adding in more images as I get them. And I will do my best to get as many watermark free as possible.
