SheWired has a new feature, where they tell you what's up this week that women might be interested in. Why would women want to watch CSI? Why else:
<blockquote>In this, our newest recurring feature, _SheWired_ editors will get you the low-down on all the can't-miss, female-centric entertainment highlights coming up this week. Just think of it as our list of Totally Awesome Things That Will Remind You Why It Rocks To Be A Woman. Don't worry, you can thank us later.

**5. DVD: _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: The Thirteenth Season_**
There are a lot of reasons why the original _CSI, _a show that changed the TV landscape, is still going strong and Elizabeth Shue (so sexy and sassy in middle-age) is among the tops. Sure, the DVD set has the whole season of hot investigators scouring the scene, collecting evidence, solving mysteries and a ton of extras around talking heads and guest stars (Ozzy Osbourne, Chris Evert) and two must-sees: _The Extended Family,_ which follows the smaller characters on the series, and _Drawing Blood,_ real crime scene experts on creating realistic scenes. But the real reason any lesbian worth her salt still watches _CSI:_ Jorja Fox.
