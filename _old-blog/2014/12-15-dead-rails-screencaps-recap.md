This was one of those fun, slightly silly, red-herring OOPS not a red-herring episodes that can be fun and enjoyable. It's the sort that even though there are only two Sara scenes, I don't fast-forward through.

I love how that shot made Jorja look like she had red hair.

Next week? More death on CSI, and yes, Jorja.
