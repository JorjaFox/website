... Said Jorja 14 years ago.

Gotcha with the headline, didn't I? Australia is just starting season fourteen, and news.com.au has a kind of new article/interview from Jorja. Most of it's stuff we already knew, and I can confirm she really loves what she does.
<blockquote>Being on a successful show is the coolest thing that could ever happen to a person. I wouldn’t trade it for anything, but I think I show up because I love being with the people that I get to work with every day and get to see where we are going to go together and what we are going to do.

That hasn’t changed for a minute even though the show has been through so many changes and losses. I will never give up on the idea of a musical episode. I know I have been plugging away trying to convince the producers for 14 years that we could really pull off an awesome musical, so there is that dream.

I think this show, is really about love in many ways — how through all this darkness and murk and ugliness, what really keeps these people going is love.

Love whether it’s in a friendship, love in a romantic way.

I think (my character) Sara Sidle will always pine for Grissom.</blockquote>
