Season 11 wraps up filming on Tuesday (by all reports), and Jeffery Hunt has been tantalizing us with pictures behind the scenes!  While <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Huntvision/status/56531250005016576">George Eads</a> was done Friday, Jorja and Eric were still filming on Saturday!

The first pic is from last week, the second from Saturday.
