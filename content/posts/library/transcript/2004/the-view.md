"The View" is a daytime television talk show on ABC which was created by Barbara Walters and premiered on August 11, 1997, to showcases women's points of view on a variety of issues.

**Star Jones:** Please welcome Jorja Fox and George Eads!

**Star:** We're out here in the sunshine... you guys are used to being in Vegas because CSI is shot-

**Jorja Fox:** Not, not during daylight hours though. _laughs, raises her hand to shade her eyes from the sun_

**Star:** Yeah, I know. Death so happens in the nighttime, normally.

**George Eads:** Yeah.

**Star:** So, any good gambling stories?

**Jorja:** _turns to George_ Well...

**George:** Um, I won $6,000 dollars once on a video poker machine.

**Star:** You did?

**Jorja:** I shopped well on that money.

**Star:** You have to share it.

**Jorja**: _nodding_ Actually...

**George:** Well video poker, it's kind of a slower game, and I was playing with my dad, and we were really just catching up and I go _gesturing, look of mock surprise_, 'Oh, Dad, I think I won a lot of money'.

**Star:** Actually you're wrong, you won 600, didn't you George.

**George:** No I won 6,000 and my dad had so much anxiety about gambling, it was every time you put the money in _pretending to wipe sweat from his face_ it's just 'Oh', I thought he was going to like pass out. So I just counted the money.

**Star:** _pushing it_ I heard somewhere it was just 600 dollars,

**George:** Well actually it was-

**Star:** Because 6,000 generates a lot more taxes.

**George:** Oh I paid all the taxes on it. _smirks at the crowd_

**Star:** This is why lawyers can't "stand" detectives 'cause they don't stiff, they don't get it off. CSI is the number one prime time show in America. _applause from the audience and crowd_

**Star:** I'm, I'm still amazed because it's one of my favorite shows, you know I like all that forensics stuff. Does that, do you find that amazing?

**Jorja:** Thank you. _gesturing_ I'm instantly blown away, completely blown away. But weekly I mean it's always a surprise, every week when it happens, it's always a surprise because you know, you never ever think it's going to happen again, and then...

**Star:** Again.

**Jorja:** Sometimes it happens again.

**Star:** And again and again and again...

**Meredith Viera:** You learn a lot of stuff, don't you.

**Jorja:** Not much.

**Meredith:** You don't learn anything?

**Jorja:** No, I don't.

**George:** Well, I think, I think when, a lot of times it can be a little intimidating so you just, like 'aminonapathenetrisulphonic acid'. _general laughter_ I woke up in my sleep the night before saying that one. _more laughter_

**George:** But if you don't know what it, uh, what it means you kind of define it, phonetically pronounce it, and uh, there's a tech there to show you how it's applied.

**Jorja:** I just write it on my hand.

**Meredith:** And then you fake it.

**George:** And then we fake it real good.

**Jorja:** I write it on my hand. _pushes her cap back a bit, looks down at her hand as if reading something written there_

**Elisabeth Hasselbeck:** Well we were here for a week and we've had so much fun already I can't even imagine what it's like to have this city for your backdrop all the time. There's got to be some crazy things that happen.

**George:** Well as an actor if you have to work, uh, we kind of keep tabs on each other. Like _making a phone gesture_ 'Are you in bed? Get in bed'.

**Jorja:** It can be a little distracting. I don't know if that's been your experience, but you know when you're working, or if-

**Meredith:** It's very distracting. So much fun stuff to do.

**Jorja:** It's a lot of fun. We go home very tired.

**Elisabeth:** And we're losing all of our money.

**Jorja:** Yeah. Well I play the nickel slots.

**Meredith:** Oh really, well so does- _laughter, Barbara Walters reaches over, shakes Jorja Fox' hand_

**Barbara Walters:** ...I have it all worked out. You and I play the nickel slots-

**Jorja:** Yeah.

**Walters:** I wouldn't mind having a romance with you, you're a great kid.

**Meredith:** Hey!

_George Eads - on the opposite side of Jorja from Barbara - gets up slowly and pretends to start to go over to hug Barbara_

**Meredith:** Barbara, Barbara, calm yourself!

_George Eads sits back down, starts to crawl into Jorja's lap while reaching out his hand to Barbara; Jorja pushes him back_

**Jorja:** Fend him off. I'm going to fight him off. _George Eads sits back down_

**Barbara:** Remember that your father is benefitting. Is it true that a lot of what you- _turns to Meredith_ I thought that was very nice of you.

**Meredith:** Yeah, very polite.

**Barbara:** Is it true that you based a lot of your character on your father who's a district attorney, in Texas?

**George:** Yeah, my, I think my dad carried a lot of angst as a D.A. for 28 years. Um, it was almost like Clint Eastwood at work and then he would come home-

**Barbara:** Was it tough with your father?

**George:** -and he's... It really got to him after a while, the, it's the wake of sorrow that's left after you lose someone that I think was the hardest thing for him to handle, and, and getting to play a character that can kind of have those emotions and passions for the victims, that kind of can't speak for themselves any more, and uh, I was just so inspired by his passion for his work, it's kind of fun to play dad a little bit. Hi, Dad.

**Joy Behar:** My dad was actually a medical examiner, a family doc, so I can relate to a lot of the scenes, in your show. But there's a lot of gore - how do you guys handle that?

**Jorja:** I'm nauseous most of the time.

**Joy:** You are nauseous?

**George:** Try not to eat.

**Jorja:** No, we don't eat much.

**George:** Before you go to work.

**Jorja:** At work.

**George:** No, it, that, sometimes, when I don't think it can get any grosser...

**Star:** And then it does.

**George:** We had an episode that we just shot last week where um, _laughs_, someone had been-

**Jorja:** That's funny. _laughs_ You're laughing.

**George:** I don't know why it's funny.

**Jorja:** It's funny because-

**George:** Because it's make-believe.

**Jorja:** -it's so disgusting.

**George:** -where an inmate tried to escape from prison by attaching themselves to the bottom of a bus, unsuccessfully. _chorus of disgust noise_

**Star:** I always hate the ones you do where there're floaters, where the people come out of the water,

**Jorja:** Yeah.

**Star:** You all like the floating scenes.

**Meredith:** I did that once, where I didn't have a Metro card.

**George:** No?

**Meredith:** _gesturing_ Sometimes you just have to get some place, you know?

**Elisabeth:** I would, I would just have a tough time, y'know, leaving and going to sleep at night, dealing with the forensic science and all the darkness and gruesome-

**Jorja:** Nightmares.

**Elisabeth:** Until, nightmares.

**Jorja:** If I read the scripts before I go to bed I still get nightmares.

**Elisabeth:** I wouldn't be able to do it.

**Jorja:** Drink a lot of beers.

**George:** Yeah, there's some - I don't really get nightmares that are full on beginning, middle, and end stories that I can remember, but, there are flashes in my mind that wake me up sometimes but...

**Barbara:** Do you think that's what one of the reasons the show is so popular is because of the gore? _she points at George_ Are you going to tear- _George starts to gesture at Jorja with his thumb, Meredith interrupts_

**Meredith:** Why does everybody keep bringing Al Gore into this? (laughter) Leave him alone, he lost. Leave him alone. The gore, the gore, the gore. (more laughter)

**Jorja:** He didn't lose, he-

**Barbara:** What a nice compliment you just got from your partner, that's very sweet.

**Jorja:** Yes, thank you. Very kind.

**Star:** Well I still say-

**Jorja:** He's my man.

**Star:** -you play one of the best casts on television, I love watching you all, I have since the beginning and we big fans of the show, so-

**Jorja:** Thank you so much.

**Star:** Thank you very much, thank you for bringing us to Vegas also. Every single week. I thank you Jorja Fox and to George Eads, CSI airs Thursday night, and we'll be right back.
