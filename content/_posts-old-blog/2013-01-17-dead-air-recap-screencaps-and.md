<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/01/deadair-395.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6183" alt="deadair-395" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/01/deadair-395.jpeg" width="275" height="140" /></a>Well. That was a GSR heavy episode! I got distracted in the middle, because I was struck by how well Jorja and Ted Danson resonate off each other. Jorja can have chemistry with a rock, but every now and then you get a pair of actors who click with such a perfect style, that you can believe not only are they in the same make believe world, but they're real. They did that tonight, with out a single false note. It was just a pure pleasure to see, and made me remark that I wish Jorja would take the lead spot so she and Ted could do this more often. They're successors to Marg and Billy in that way.

That aside, the case was entertaining (I'm glad they didn't tie Nick's B&amp;E in like they did Finn's arson), and everyone who spent time with Sara knew something was 'off.' Perhaps that's why she avoided her friends. Five stars for Sara. Ratings were low, but this was also American Idol premiere night, and CBS got second place for the hour. Miles above everyone else for drama at 10pm, so that's good.

CBS has been making memes and I had to laugh at this one:

But you probably want the links to the goods, right?

You know I rarely put up clips of episodes, right? This one is for everyone outside the US, who can't torrent.
