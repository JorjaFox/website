Oh fine, it's CBS Eye-lert, but I had to make the joke.
<blockquote><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11222" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/09/cbs-eye-lert.jpg" alt="CBS Eye-Lert notice" width="900" height="220" />New for the coming TV Season, the “CBS Eye-lert” system is inviting TV-philes to download the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/eye-lerts/">CBS App for iOS</a>, to set up mobile push notifications about Sunday delays. Also at the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/eye-lerts/">CBS Eye-lert website</a>, you can click to follow the network’s Facebook and/or Twitter feeds, which also report on start time delays.

CBS’ Sunday line-up this fall opens with _60 Minutes_ at 7/6c, followed by the new Tea Leoni drama _Madam Secretary_, _The Good Wife_ and a relocated _CSI_.</blockquote>
