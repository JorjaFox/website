Seriously? You're 45? Okay, I can see you're older than you were inÂ _Missing Persons_, but 45? No way.

Happy birthday, Jorja, keep up the good work for animals, vegetarians, and of course, the awesome acting.

(There's no official JFO managed fundraiser this year, but I encourage you all to donate where your heart tells you. Me? It was myriad. Some was to NoH8, some to Texas for their fight to keep abortions legal and available, and some was to an animal shelter.)
