## Synopsis

Grissom finally opens a packaged delivered shortly after he left for sabbatical, and it turns out to be another miniature from the miniature crime scene killer. A note left, in pieces on the various miniatures, reads 'You were wrong.' Since the package was sent after Ernie Dell suicided, the real killer is still at large. The miniature has the murder planned for two days time, and the CSIs are able to find Dr. Barbara Tallman shortly before that. They have an officer play decoy, hoping to catch the killer in the act, but instead the officer is killed by Parkinson's disease.

Ernie Dell had a son, born in 1983, Lionel Dell, who renamed himself Mitchell Douglas and spent time in a halfway house, which Dr. Tallman worked at for a while. Lionel reveals that his parents had fostered a good number of foster children, all from before Lionel was born. With at least thirteen foster kids and few names, the CSIs have their work cut out for them.

## Review

Sara introduces Warrick and Nick to the particulars of the miniature cases. She is suspicious of Ernie Dell not having any relatives, and goes through his home movies to learn more about him. Sara finds Dell's son and determines he never got along well with his father.

## Notes

* Sara is incensed about how the chicken slaughter factory treats animals, while providing benefits to its employees.
* Sara reacts to the mention of the foster situation, a reminder of her own history.
