<blockquote>**CSI Files**: You said that you watched the show in its early seasons and you just described Morgan and her mentality. Would you agree—and there’s a lot of discussion about this—that Morgan is similar to Sara from the first couple of seasons?

**Harnois**: Yes. Yes I would. Sara was very impassioned by things and she got emotionally involved. She’d get in fights with Nick; “you don’t care”! Or “you don’t understand!” She had a very sort of… I guess the word is not sophomoric, but when you’re new to something and you’re very impassioned and driven by something. That’s very much the spirit of Morgan. She’s still very excited by everything that happens and she’s also very impassioned about making sure the right thing happens in the end. I think that’s a very good comparison and I’m flattered by the comparison actually. I think **Jorja** [**Fox**] is awesome and she did a great job with her character over the years.</blockquote>
