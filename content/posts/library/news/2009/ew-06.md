**Question: What’s this I hear about some unexpected surprise coming out in the *CSI* premiere about Sara? --Encarni
Ausiello:** [www.people.com/people/videos/0,,20306231,00.html She got hitched to Grissom when no one was looking]. But that’s old news. Here’s some (relatively) new news from exec producer Naren Shankar: “Do not miss the first two-and-a-half minutes of *CSI* season premiere. It will blow your mind. It may be one of the most incredible things we’ve ever put on film. It’s so beautiful and it’s so cool.”

**Question: Any chance Jorja Fox may stick around full-time on *CSI*? Five episodes isn’t enough. --Brian
Ausiello:** I posed that question to Shankar, and, based on his evasiveness, I would say it’s probably being discussed. “I honestly can’t say [for sure] at this point,” he told me. “All I will say is we’re having a great time and I think Jorja is having a great time. I think she’s having more fun now than she did before. Having a little space from something, you get to clean your palate and be refreshed as an artist.”
