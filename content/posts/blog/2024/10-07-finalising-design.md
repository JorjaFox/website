I'm sure many have noticed the small (and large) changes to the design over the last 3 months. Part of it was me learning a new system, the other part was learning I was getting laid off at the end of October (yaaaaay).

Right now the design is what I call 'stable' (mobile was a pill) but I wanted to let you know where it's going. Basically I'm where I consider the site redesign done. This is the new look and feel, it's mobile friendly, it's dark mode friendly, and it's fast.

I've gotten the okay to restore _some_ images. If you check out [Drop Dead Diva](/library/actor/drop-dead-diva/) you'll see some images in a gallery at the bottom of the page! My plan is to restore as many as I can to all the episode recap pages, which means everything will be in one place for a change. You can even [link people right to the gallery](/library/actor/drop-dead-diva/#gallery). I've done the easy ones which means everything except _CSI_ (the original), as I'm sure that will take ages. But so you can see how it'll look for recaps, check out [Calling Dr. Hathaway](/library/recaps/er/calling-dr-hathaway/#gallery) or even [Legacy](/library/recaps/csi-vegas/0101-legacy/#gallery).

For the person who worried about the images on Github, the images are on a separate server, so you won't see them there. Speaking of Github? If you're nerdy and want to contribute, the site code is at [Github](https://github.com/JorjaFox/website/)! I'm going to make some templates so people can use that to submit missing articles and so on.

I'm currently working on some GDPR compliance for handling privacy. Right now, the only service used is Google Analytics. No ads, no tracking. Still, I care a lot about privacy. I also want to figure out a sane contact form, so you can ... contact me with suggestions. Until them, `webmaster@jorjafox.net` will reach me.

Social media ... I don't know where I'm going with it. I can't use Twitter because it's insane, Facebook isn't much better. I do have a (personal) BlueSky account, and a Mastodon one, but neither are (yet) popular enough to justify making one for FLF.

After that? Well now that the site is on Hugo, it's incredibly fast (as you may have noticed) and harder to hack (which gives me some relief). It's funny how full circle things have come. It's annoying to be writing content in a code editor, but at the same time, it makes everything easier on me knowing the lower risk if I have to step away to deal with work.
