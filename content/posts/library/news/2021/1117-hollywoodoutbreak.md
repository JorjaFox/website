The return of William Petersen and Jorja Fox to the new CSI show, CSI: Vegas, isn’t just a return to their old characters — it’s the first time either of them has taken a starring role on a television show since the original CSI’s finale. That being the case, both Petersen and Fox admitted to being a little rusty when they showed up at the new CSI: Vegas set, and they talked to us about the toughest part about trying to pick up where they’d left off. [...]

**Jorja Fox:** I was a little rusty, for sure, on all things science. You know, even with this pandemic, just being on a set, hitting my mark, and really simple actor-y stuff, I was a little rusty at. Billy?

**William Petersen:** I hadn't done any television acting in a long time. Like, since we did the finale. It's interesting, because it's a whole new lab, it's new construction, it's all kinds of new machines, new technology that Grissom wouldn't have been all that comfortable with ten years ago. So yeah! I think the skills in the lab itself were sort of rusty, as Jorja says. Just to be able to do a pipette and make sure that the material you're trying to transfer doesn't end up on the floor. That was ... keeping your hand steady was a trick.

**Jorja Fox:** Billy and I used to be _really_ good at that stuff!

**William Petersen:** Age caught up with me.
