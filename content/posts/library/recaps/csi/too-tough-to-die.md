## Synopsis

Sara gets a little too personally involved when she investigates the rape and shooting of a young woman who was left for dead, but who still fights for her life in a nearby hospital; Catherine and Warrick try to determine whether a fatal shooting involving two neighbors was committed in self-defense.

## Review

At the scene, Grissom tells Sara to go to the hospital and collect evidence from the victim, even though she says she'd rather stay at the scene. Sara takes samples and evidence from 'Jane Doe' at the hospital; after collecting everything, she discovers a St. Catherine's medal in the victim's belongings, and sits down to explain to the unconscious victim who St. Catherine was and why she admires her. Sara promises the victim that she'll find who did this; Grissom arrives and tries to dissuade Sara from getting too involved with the victim.

Sara, Grissom and Nick go through the evidence collected -- it's apparently a gang shooting; Sara takes the ball cap to DNA.

Later, Sara goes through missing persons reports on the computer, hoping to identify the victim. Grissom asks her if she has any diversions, anything outside of work because she maxes out on overtime every month, sits at home and listens to her police scanner, and reads forensics textbooks; if she doesn't find something to do outside of work, she'll burn out. Sara promises that she's almost finished with the computer, but instead stays all night going through reports until she identifies the victim.

A suspect is brought in, and Sara discovers that Grissom told Nick to keep her out of the interrogation room.

Sara and Nick are back in the lab, and Sara begins to sing to herself again (Blondie's 'One Way Or Another') -- when Nick tells her she has a nice singing voice, she denies it.

Sara goes to the hospital to tell the unconscious victim that they found the assailant, and meets the victim's husband. Sara is barely able to control her emotions. She talks to Grissom about the victim and loses control, crying. She says that she wishes she was like Grissom, without feelings.

## Notes

* Sara admires brave women such as St. Catherine.
* Sara gets obsessive with some cases -- in this instance, staying up all night going through computer reports.
* Sara's only activities outside of work are reading forensics textbooks and listening to her police scanner.
* Sara puts in the maximum allowable amount of overtime every month.
* Sara gets quite emotional and involved with certain cases, mainly rape and domestic abuse.
* Sara sings to herself, but claims she doesn't even know she's doing it.
* Sara admires -- in a backhanded manner -- Grissom's lack of feelings.
