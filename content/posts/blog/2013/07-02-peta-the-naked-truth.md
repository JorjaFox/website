Newkirk, PETA's president and top firebrand, puts her spin on the animal rights movement's trajectory. Controversial, truthful, and always thought-provoking, Ingrid has some electrifying thoughts to share about animals, our relationship with them, and how that relationship can and should evolve.</blockquote>

(There's one in Chicago on the 15th, which I was invited too by PETA and cannot attend for hilarious reasons of living south of LA now.)
