Jorja Fox plays the brainy brunette on CSI. She demonstrates her smarts by confessing, "The only crime here is that we don't have bicycles." Jorja and Katherine of SpinDaily visit Orange 20 Bikes in Los Angeles, trying out a hybrid, a nice Breezer Bike, and even a fixed gear bicycle. Jorja needs a bike that can carry a surf board on the bike.

Some select quotes:

* "If I had a bike, I wouldn't have to worry about two hour parking or parking meters. It would save me hundreds of dollars a year on parking tickets."
* "Prius. That's a cop out."
* (After trying a fixed gear): "That is awesome. You should try this, Kat. I've never ridden anything like that. It's so cool." After that, Katherine tries to trackstand and falls flat over, but big props to her for trying!
