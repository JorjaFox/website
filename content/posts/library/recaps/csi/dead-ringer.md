## Synopsis

Grissom, Catherine and Nick investigate the death of a runner during a competition. Meanwhile Sara and Warrick investigate the death of couple in a hotel room, initially thought to be a murder-suicide. Both cases take place during this 'cop' competition , with more than 20.000 attendants (all of them cops). This gives the investigations an interesting turn, as almost all the suspects and all dead people are cops.

## Review

Sara takes part in the police relay marathon, and hugs Greg when she finishes her leg of the course. Sara and Warrick investigate the deaths of two visiting cops, found dead in a hotel room -- they discover that one of the victims was married, and having an affair. Sara gets a little confrontational when questioning the woman the cop was having an affair with. Later Sara confronts the wife, and eventually they discover that she's the killer.

## Notes

* Sara is aware of some types of male sexual fantasy.
* Sara comments negatively on the lingerie found.

## Quotes

**Warrick:** What happened? Break the bad news to the wife?
**Sara:** Oh, I didn't have to.
**Warrick:** Women always know, huh?
**Sara:** Not always.
**Warrick:** I think so. Women always know when the man is straying.
**Sara:** What are you, the voice of experience?
**Warrick:** _(laughing)_ No. I'm a really nice guy.
**Sara:** Oh, I believe you.

**Sara:** That's it? _(Franco nods)_ Are you sure? _(Franco looks at Sara, surprised that she'd ask)_ I-I'm sorry. It just doesn't make any sense. The sex kits came back negative, and now this. I mean, that room reeked of musk.

**Sara:** I don't know. Isn't the prevailing male fantasy two on one?

**Warrick:** Well, someone was pissed. This is, like, a two, three hundred La Perle nightie, ripped to shreds.
**Sara:** _(sarcastic)_ Oh, looks comfortable.
**Warrick:** It's not designed to stay on that long.

**Sara:** How could you know that if the only part you know is his body?
**Lopez** Pedestal's a little high, don't you think?
**Sara:** Your best friend, your lover are dead. What do you expect me to think?

**Sara:** What do guys do when they're drunk, and they have a number burning a hole in their pocket?
