With the fire only 20% contained (depending on who you listen to), it's no shock that the Gala has been rescheduled to September 12th and moved to The Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. The Gala is, usually, where up to half the operating costs for Animal Acres is recouped.  The evacuation will strain the budget, so if you have any extra funds in your pockets, please consider passing it on to the animals, who can't ask you for help.

Their website has yet to be updated with the information (not surprising, they're a little busy) so I'm including the newsletter here again.  Jorja has not yet been confirmed as attending.

THE RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB IN PACIFIC PALISADES WILL BE HOSTING THE ANIMAL ACRES GALA ON SEPTEMBER 12TH!**

As you know, Animal Acres is in the middle of the worst fire storm in California, prompting the evacuation of ALL of the sanctuary animals. We are all safe and sound, and working at the evacuation center to provide the best care possible by building additional shade shelters, installing automatic waters, misters to keep the animals cool, and other care needs.

At the same time, we had to focus on our upcoming Gala and make an alternative plan as we could no longer hold the Gala on September 5th, or host the Gala at Animal Acres.  The fire is still only 22% contained, and will continue for several more days, or longer.

We hope everyone who has purchased tables and tickets, along with anyone interested in attending, will be able to join us on September 12th.  We need your support more than ever. Our annual Gala provides almost half of the funding needed to operate our shelter annually -- and now we have even more animal care costs because of the evacuation. A limited number of tickets are still available, however we do expect a sold-out Gala soon, and we will not be able to accomodate any additional reservations due to ballroom seating arrangements.

Though we know you understand why the Gala had to be rescheduled, we do regret any inconvenience this has caused to our Gala guests, and are happy to assist you in any way possible. Please call us at 661-269-5404 or email info@animalacres.org if you need assistance.

As this alert is sent to you, we are working on the details, however here is information we have available to assist with your Gala plans.
