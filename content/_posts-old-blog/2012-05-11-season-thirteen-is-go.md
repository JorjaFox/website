<blockquote><em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>'s <strong>Jorja Fox </strong>is remaining on the case.

The actress has signed a new one-year deal with CBS Television Studios to remain on the long-running procedural,<em><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> </em>has learned exclusively.

Fox plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the CBS drama, a role she first stepped into in the second episode of the <strong>Anthony Zuiker</strong> procedural in 2000. The actress, who departed the series as a regular in late 2007, returned in May 2008 as a guest star in a handful of episodes. She was later upped to recurring in 2009 and returned to her role as a series regular in July 2011.

Fox's new deal comes less than two weeks after co-star<strong>George Eads </strong>re-upped with the studio to return for<em>CSI</em>'s upcoming 13th season.

Following a tumultuous season that saw the series uprooted from its longtime Thursday time slot to Wednesdays, the billion-dollar franchise saw <strong>Ted Danson </strong>take over for <strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong> at the beginning of the season, later being joined by<strong>Elisabeth Shue</strong>, who replaced <strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong>. <strong>Peri Gilpin</strong> made her debut as <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/csi-peri-gilpin-ted-danson-wife-308772">the wife to Danson's D.B. Russell</a> during Wednesday's Season 12 finale, which was up a tenth of a point week-over-week with a 2.4 rating in the key adults 18-49 demographic.

Fox is repped by Domain Talent and Framework Entertainment.</blockquote>
