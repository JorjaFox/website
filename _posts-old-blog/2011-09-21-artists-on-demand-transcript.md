<blockquote>**ARTIST ON DEMAND:** Very awesome. Now, aside from _CSI_, anything you're working on right now?

**JORJA FOX:** Oh gosh, I’m always shuttling around my little projects that I love. I have a feature documentary that we've just finished. That’s really the story of 14-year old girl that goes to Thailand to learn about elephants. The movie’s called "How I Became An Elephant.” We have a website, it’s <a href="http://howibecameanelephant.com/">http://howibecameanelephant.com</a>, and we’ve submitted to festivals. It’s a really exciting documentary. There are some hard things to watch, obviously. Elephants sometimes get a raw deal in our post-modern world, where space is at a premium. It’s a beautiful story. We’re hoping -- We’re going to do the festivals for a few months. We’re talking to distributors.

I would love to tell you more about that in a few months.</blockquote>
Since Jorja brought it up, I'd like to remind you that her movie could use _your_ help!  Go to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timgorski/how-i-became-an-elephant">How I Became An Elephant Kickstarter page</a> and donate today!  The money only counts if we raise enough!
