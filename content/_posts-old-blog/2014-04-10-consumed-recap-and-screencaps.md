That was tasty and I have to give them a hand for a nice episode with a great "Oh <em>shit</em>." ending that reminds me of Abra-Cadaver. It was gross, and awesome, and gross. This is the kind of CSI I love the most.

I'm giving this one four stars because of the number of scenes, but it's really like a 3.75. If we'd had one mention of Sara's personal life, it would be a more solid 4. It was an above-average Sara episode, but not a ZOMG! episode for her. Still, this is one of the ones I enjoyed watching.

No new CSI next week. Also the next episode will be "Kitty Porn" which is the <em>possible</em> spin-off episode (I think they're holding off on renewing Intelligence until they see how this is received because they're rather similar).

Jorja <strong>is not</strong> in Kitty Porn. Take a week off and enjoy!
