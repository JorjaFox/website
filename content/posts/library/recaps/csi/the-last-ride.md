## Synopsis

A woman, Eva Montrose, is found dead of asphyxiation from being painted solid silver and swallowing it. The paint used was special, eco-friendly, car chrome paint. Based on the bruise pattern on her back and the shards of headlamp in her arm, the CSIs track down a classic Packard car and it's owner... Eva's ex-boyfriend, Carlo Derosa.

Sara and Finn talk to Carlo and his brother, Aron, who own a collection of classic cars, including the Packard. They find evidence that Eva was killed there, but a classic Cadillac is missing, used to transport her body. The Caddy was also the car where their father, Vegas legend Alfonso Derosa, was murdered, and it's worth around $1 million.

The find the car in a storage unit rented by Eva, along with Aron who tracked the car down. The brothers blame each other for the murder but it's Eva's mother, Ruth, who is a suspect. She was attempting to buy the Caddy from Carlo for a man from Dubai, while Aron refused to sell, so she asked Eva to help her steal it. Except Ruth's boyfriend, Duncan Ridell, is the son of the man who killed Alfonso and was, oddly enough, not her buyer.

But the killer was the car appraiser, Ken Bixler, who was also the real killer of Alfonso. He was there to kill Vera, Alfonso's mistress and Ken's fianc√©e. Eva asked Ken to help her steal the car, knowing him from her drug days, and Ken stole the headrest to cover his murder of Vera and Alfonso. Eva stumbled on him and he killed her.

## Review

Sara gives the death notification to Eva's parents and goes with Finn to find the cars. When Carlo's a bit of a dick and tries to ignore them, she bumps his expensive car and sets off the alarm.

## Notes

* Sara hates when people lie to her
