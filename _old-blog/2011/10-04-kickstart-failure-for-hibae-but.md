<blockquote>We want you to stay with us on this road to elephant liberation, so we've designed 2 other ways for you to contribute to the completion of the film. Go to our website -<a href="http://www.howibecameanelephant.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.howibecameanelephant.com</a> - and click on "Donate Now" or on the "Facebook Cause" link ( <a href="http://www.causes.com/HIBE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.causes.com/HIBE</a> ). They are both on the right side of the homepage. We will include you in the film credits based on a similar tier system to our Kickstarter campaign. Smaller donations will receive "Special Thanks” in the film and a download link when the film is available online. Larger donors (depending on amount) will receive associate producer or producer credits -<a href="http://www.howibecameanelephant.com/film-credits/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.howibecameanelephant.com/film-credits/</a> . We will also make every effort to fulfill our other pledge perks from Kickstarter. A great example is Jennifer Wright of Green Shift Canada who pledged to complete the music score. She agreed to donate directly to our account (which, I might add, is better for us because Kickstarter takes a percentage). She and her company are both credited in the film. See "Film Credits" under "The Film" link on our homepage.</blockquote>
So since your money came back, how about giving it away again!
