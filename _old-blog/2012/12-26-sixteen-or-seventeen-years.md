If you count my homework assignment, then the site was born in mid 1995. If you count when it went live to the general public, it was December 1996. I usually think of the latter as the real birthday of JFO, since before then no one but my teacher and I saw it. I do wish I had that website.

So the 'age' of this site is pretty mutable. I was 18 going on 19 then, I'm 35 going on 36 now. We're getting on near half my life with this hobby, and I regret none of it. You guys may not understand how massive my job change was, but it's a direct result of this site. I would never have been able to do it without my insatiable desire to tinker with JFO.

2012 has been an amazing year for me. 2013 looks to be pretty awesome too. Thank you guys for encouragement, and I hope your holiday season goes well. Next up for me: Figuring out where to spend New Years. Anyone think Disney's a good place for fireworks? It's just down the road from my place.

PS: Why no Holiday Fundraiser? The economy plus I moved in October. I feel 'caught up' now, but skipping this winter seemed better for my sanity.
