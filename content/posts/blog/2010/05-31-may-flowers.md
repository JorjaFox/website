<h2>CSI</h2>
Well. That was an interesting end to the season.  I don't know about you, but I was pretty peeved in the end. All the promises of explaining why Sara's back in Vegas weren't kept, which certainly kept me from really being involved in the Dr. Jekyll killings.  As a whole, it's a 3-star Sara Season, taking into account the fact that she's a guest star. Had she been a main cast member, I'd have given it a two.

As for next season?  Well it might help if anyone's talked to Jorja about staying. It sounds like they haven't. But then again, they haven't talked to Marg or George either.  This is normal enough. We'll know more at the end of June or July, most likely.

<h2>Jorja News</h2>
For TV related news, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/drop-dead-diva-now-on-hulu/">Drop Dead Diva is now available on Hulu</a>, so you can watch "Second Chances" for free!  Also, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/missing-persons-on-dvd-july-27th/">Missing Persons will be on sale on DVD this summer</a>. I know! Who saw that coming?

Jorja was also the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/?p=2434">witness to a 2006 crime</a> and testified on behalf of an arrested surfer.  Also, the photographer from a 2002 Contents magazine photo shoot, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/harry-middleton-portfolio/">Harry Middleton</a>, put up a stunning picture of Jorja on his site.

<h3>Bolivian Lion Rescue</h3>
At the end of the month, Jorja helped rescue lions from Bolivia.  Bolivia recently banned the use of animals in the circus, but that bought up the issue of where to put these partly domesticated animals. Animal Defenders International (ADI) worked with Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) to build a sanctuary for the lions in California.

As the ADI spokesperson, Jorja  was set to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/welcome-rescued-lions/">welcome the rescued lions</a>.  But due to the complications involved, the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/lion-rescue-delayed/">lion rescue was delayed</a> until <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/lions-eta-may-27th/">May 27th</a>.  Jorja gave a status update that the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/bolivian-lions-on-track-to-sfo/">lions were on track to SFO</a> and, with the rest of the ADI team, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/awaiting-lions/">awaited their arrival, late that night</a>.

When the lions arrived, Jorja was on hand and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/photos-the-lions-arrive/">helped water the lions</a> before their trip to their new home.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/one-more-lion-video/">At the airport</a>, she was <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/cbs-lion-rescue-interview/">interviewed by CBS</a> and then went with the lions to Ark 2000, where she <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/the-lions-roam-free/">opened the gate to let them into their new home</a>.

<h2>JFO News</h2>
At the end of the month, I, Ipstenu, turned 33. Jorja turns 42 in July. In June I'm going to raise money to help clean up the Gulf from that oil spill. I'll post the info in a day or so.
