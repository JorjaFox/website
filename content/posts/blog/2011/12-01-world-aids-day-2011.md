<img class="alignleft" title="actaware" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/12/actaware-100x100.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" />According to UNAIDS estimates, there are now **33.3 million **people living with HIV, including 2.5 million _children_. During 2009 some 2.6 million people became newly infected with the virus and an estimated 1.8 million people died from AIDS.

**We don't have a cure, folks.** We have treatments that can extend the life of people with HIV/AIDS, but as my friends will tell you, it's not much more than hope right now. This isn't just a problem in the UK, too. In the US, awareness is declining! Instead of more people learning more and being smarter and safer, people are acting stupider! We need to stop this, because until we have a cure, the best we can do is act smarter.

HIV/AIDS doesn't _just_ infect drug users and homosexual men, and you can't get it from hugging someone with HIV/AIDS. Ignoring the facts, or not learning about them at all, is why there are places in the world where people think the _cure_ for HIV/AIDS is to have sex with a virgin. If that made you a little sick to think about, good.
