 Sara Sidle is back from Costa Rica and on the case at "**CSI**."

Actress **Jorja Fox** will appear in five episodes, including the season premiere, in the CBS forensic series' 10th season, according to **The Hollywood Reporter**.

When last we saw the tenacious CSI, she was in Costa Rica, reunited with and kissing her fellow forensic honey, Gil Grissom (William Petersen).

Despite the characters' romantic relationship, however, there are no immediate plans for Petersen to return for episodes this season.

Fox was a regular cast member for eight seasons before her character Sara Sidle got job burnout and left. She appeared in various episodes in Season Nine.

The 10th season of "CSI" premieres on Sept. 24.
