## Synopsis

Warrick is the focus of this intense hour in which he allows emotion to trump evidence when he investigates a drive-by shooting in his old neighborhood. Gunfire rips through the house of Warrick's former mentor, who runs a recreational center, killing his 9-year-old daughter in her bedroom. Officers believe the actual target was a white teen who was dropping off his black girlfriend next door. One of the key suspects was once a school bully who tormented Warrick as a youth. When a suspect is nabbed with the murder weapon, a vengeful Warrick is certain the man is guilty--an assumption that leads to even more violence. Also, Nicky enters the world of cubicle dwellers as he looks for clues into the case of a highly disliked man who lay dead for hours in the computer room, before his geeky computer programmer subordinates noticed anything was amiss. And all of them had plenty of motive to off their boss.
