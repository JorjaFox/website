<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/03/summerstories.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/03/summerstories-100x100.jpg" alt="Summer Stories: Diane" title="Summer Stories: Diane" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1689" /></a> Mondo props to <a href="http://kc-from-kc.livejournal.com/">kc_from_kc</a> for pulling this rabbit out of the archives. It's a simple review of the cheesy and rather awful 1992 ABC After School Special "Summer Stories: The Mall."  Why mention it here? Because 17 years ago, the reviewer saw something that visitors here have always known.  Jorja's got talent.

<blockquote>In subsequent stories, Marla Clayton (Samaria Graham) will have to come to terms with her widowed mother's pending remarriage, and Diane Dravecki (Jorjan Fox) will battle against slipping back into crack addiction.

Beneath the usual television gloss there's a new grittiness, evident even in the casting, which clearly has tried to avoid stereotypically pretty new faces. Some of the actors, especially the intriguingly offbeat Ms. Fox, impressively convey the value of pure talent.</blockquote>
