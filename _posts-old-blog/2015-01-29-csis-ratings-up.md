You know I don't normally post about ratings. Since _CSI_ has been pretty iffy for a renewal (I still think it'll get at least a 'final season'), it was really gratifying to see how much the ratings went up.

So what are the numbers? From <a href="http://tvline.com/2015/01/28/csi-season-15-ratings-high/">TV|Line</a>:

<blockquote>Leading out of an _NCIS: New Orleans_ rerun (11.6 mil/1.6), a special broadcast of _CSI_ on Tuesday drew 10.3 million total viewers and a 1.6 demo rating, up 24 and 33 percent from its Sunday double-pump to hit Season 15 highs in both measures.</blockquote>

Two things to note that I feel are important.

<ol>
	<li>This was behind a repeat episode of _NCIS_ and _NCIS:NOLA_ (a new show)</li>
	<li>This was with not a whole lot of advertising</li>
</ol>

If you didn't watch _CSI_ you probably wouldn't have known it was on in advance, which means a high number of people who watched were people who stuck around after _NCIS/NCIS:NOLA_'s reruns.

Without DVR adjustments, _NCIS_ was 12.89 mill/1.6, _NCIS:NOLA_ was 11.72 mill/1.6, and _CSI_ was a 10.38mil/1.6. That's ... actually really good. In general, _CSI_ does pretty well with DVR adjustments (see <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/12/csi-has-biggest-adults-18-49-viewership-increases-in-live-7-ratings-for-week-14-ending-december-28/349265/">Zap2It's report</a>), though that doesn't factor much into renewals.

Does this mean _CSI_ will be back? I wish I knew. I think it certainly shows it has an audience and, on a weeknight, it's still popular in _Person of Interest_'s normal slot.
