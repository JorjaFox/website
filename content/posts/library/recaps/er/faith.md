## Summary

## Review

Drs. Greene and Doyle treat a patient in need for a heart transplant, but has been denied because she has Downs Syndrome. While Doyle brings her brother over to keep the patient comfortable, the mother explains she doesn't want the surgery because after she dies, her daughter will end up in a home, all alone.

## Notes

* Doyle's brother with Downs is named Jimmy.
