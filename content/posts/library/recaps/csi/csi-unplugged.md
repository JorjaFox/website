## Synopsis

A young boy, Harper Reardon, is stolen from his home, and his nanny, Shelby Buress, has gone missing. All that's found is blood covering the room when the father, TC, wakes up hours later. Just as the CSIs begin to investigate, the power goes out, forcing them to go old-school and use their heads. The nanny is found dead, with a note saying 'they' have Harper.

Shelby turns out to be the birth mother of Harper, with whom TJ was having an affair while married to another woman, Natalie, who died five years ago. TC had a seance for his dead wife, with his ex-mother-in-law, Patricia Lydecker, and Shelby, to try and contact Natalie. The medium, Karen, has been helping them talk to Natalie.

## Review

At the autopsy, Sara is delighted when David the coroner's assistant makes light in the morgue using luminol.

## Notes

* Sara and David (aka Super Dave) still flirt as friends.
* Sara and Nick confess to being out of practice reviewing prints by eye and not computer.
