Bah, we all somehow saw it coming, right? After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she's arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on "Drop Dead Diva" which aired yesterday.

That detail's been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of "CSI" was announced. She's a soccer mom with a pretty grim past, apparently, and while I probably would miss the show, it's actually a bit interesting seeing her do just that. But wait a minute. What's exactly with "Drop Dead Diva" and its penchant for pretty high-profile guests?

In Jorja's case, it was a previous connection. Series creator Josh Berman worked for "CSI" before, and he came to her with that role. "I just love the show," she said. "It reminds me a lot of "The Love Boat", which was one of my favorites as a kid. It's funny but always poignant, and I'm honored to be a part of all the amazing guest stars they're bringing in."

"I've had dreams of doing some type of a romantic comedy for years," she added. "William Petersen and myself, we drew on that as often as possible, but "CSI" isn't really the right genre for romantic comedy."

Hrmmm. Nonetheless Grissom and Sara still fell in love, eh?

Well, the rest of her interview with the "New York Daily News" was about her role on season 10 of "CSI", and most of that we already know, but if you've seen her on "Drop Dead Diva" last night, you might wanna tell me if she pulled off being a prisoner. "I've been trying to get into an orange jumpsuit for years," she said. "I hope I pulled it off." Well, did she? Did she?
