When she was abducted and buried alive, Grissom's head spun. If he needed to kill someone to find her, he would have. When she left for good Grissom felt like his whole world fell apart -- no he felt like dying was a better punishment for his inability to set aside his career for his relationship with her.

Well, Sara Sidle is back. Unfortunately Grissom (played by William Petersen) will not be. His character has been replaced by Laurence Fishbourne's, who is also not coming back -- according to reports he will be replaced next season by Ted Danson.

Yup, Jorja Fox aka Sara Sidle will no longer guest-star in the next season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She will again be a full-fledged regular character on the show's 12th season.

Fox actually spent the show's first seven seasons as a regular before leaving to 'pursue other career options' while making guest appearances every now and then - for the next four seasons.

With Gil Grissom out, I can only speculate on how Sara Sidle will make a re-appearance. Maybe, it will be Grissom's turn to pop-up every now and then.
