Having read the article, I don't know how else to say it, but when asked about expanding Nick and Sara's roles on the show, Don was pretty vague.
<blockquote><strong>JH: With these changes, did you also see an opportunity to expand on some of the other characters like Nick (George Eads) or Sara (Jorja Fox)? Take them in a different direction?</strong>

DM: 'CSI' has always had these really rich characters and we have such a great cast of actors that, yeah, in terms of storylines with Nick's storyline, Greg's [Eric Szmanda) storyline, Sara's storyline... and all of our characters we, where we can, we're looking for places to hint at a life outside the crime lab. We've touched on it a few times. Nick had a flirtation with a nurse in episode 14, which we still talked about in 15. We're opening things up a little bit for opportunities to lay in some character threads while still being true to the mission of 'CSI' and what has made it so successful, which is great crime stories every week.

<strong>JH: What are the rules for bringing people back? Petersen has been back, I'm sure you'll want Marg back maybe next season. Can you talk about how you do that?</strong>

DM: [Executive Producer] Carol Mendelsohn has always said the door's always open and no one every really leaves 'CSI' and I think that's absolutely true. For example, with Jorja Fox, Sara left 'CSI' for a bit and then came back and that's been super successful and great for the show. We talk with Billy Petersen all the time and, in fact, the episodes where we said goodbye for now to Marg Helgenberger's character, Billy was involved with that. He originally was going to be a part on-screen and there were just personal circumstances that didn't allow him to do it and we wish he had but there really are no rules. Whenever there's a great opportunity for Billy to return and we hope to create opportunities for Marg to return, the door's always open.</blockquote>
