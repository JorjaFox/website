The Humane Society of the United States is the nation's largest and most effective animal protection organization -- backed by 11 million Americans, or one in every 28. Established in 1954, The HSUS seeks a humane and sustainable world for all animals -- a world that will also benefit people. We are America's mainstream force against cruelty, exploitation and neglect, as well as the most trusted voice extolling the human-animal bond.

Jorja has attended multiple events for the Humane Society, and in 2010 was given an Animal Advocate Award.

## 9-02-10 Day

> **Jorja Fox:** I think for me, right now, especially in leiu of the Gulf disaster and I'm very concerned with the world's oceans and the state of the fishing indisutry today, those are issues that are really important to me, I'm also personally, really concerned with zoos and circuses. If I had my way, traveling circuses would become a thing of the past, the same way as lead paint and asbestos has become a thing of the past. I think we've all evolved beyond them.

> **Wayne Pacelle:** Beverly Hills has always been an outstanding advocate for animal protection. So we're privileged, very priviledged to be here, so we're going to recognize three of our outstanding supporters. Three celebrities who are doing great work, not only in this community but all across the country. We are giving out Animal Advocate Awards to these ambasadors for the community and for animal protection.

> **Jorja Fox:** What an amazingly festive and fun event. Thank you, Mr. Mayor for throwing this party, thank you, Humane Society. Beverly Hills is a glamorous city, it's a beautiful city, it's a city of good fortune and where American dreams are realized. And I think it's a testament to this city to have the Humane Society here tonight. It shows Beverly Hills is also a compassionate city and a very kind and progressive looking city. Thank you.
