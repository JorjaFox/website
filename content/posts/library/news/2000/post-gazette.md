**Who's been shot?**

It's the question fans of NBC's "The West Wing" have been asking all summer following the show's season finale shooting attack on the president and his staff. Tonight viewers will get their answer.

NBC refused to send critics tapes of new episodes out of fear that some unthinking clod would lend the tape to his brother's girlfriend's cousin who might post revelations to a Web site, spoiling the surprise for everyone.

But here's what I do know: NBC isn't going to do a thing to mess with "The West Wing," a medium-sized hit last season that's poised to become a much bigger success this fall. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if "West Wing" takes the "ER" spot on Thursday night within a few years.

Don't expect President Josiah Bartlet (Emmy nominee Martin Sheen) to die tonight, assuming he was even hit. But I wouldn't get too attached to the female Secret Service agent played by Jorja Fox. She has lined up a series regular gig starting with the second episode of CBS's "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigations." Even if she survives the "West Wing" shooting, she'll be an infrequent guest star, at best.

Moira Kelly, who played political operative Maddy Hampton, was not caught in the gunfire, but her character will disappear from the show.
