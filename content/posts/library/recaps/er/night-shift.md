## Summary

A long, cold night finds ER staffers with hours of time to kill. Kerry recruits staffers to participate in a study on sleep deprivation combined with physical activity. Gant appeals to Anspaugh after a public scolding from Benton. Carter ditches Dennis again to escape his whining, only to discover deadly results. Peter is denied a recommendation from Keaton one last time before she leaves for Pakistan. Mark and Chuny discover that they have a lot in common. Carol is at a crossroads when management demands she cut two RNs. Charlie comes into the ER severely beaten.

## Review

The whole episode, Carter and Doyle are nudging each other, in a friendly competition about who's better: ER vs. surgical. While they're still at it at the end of the episode, it's Doyle who twigs to the fact that they're working on their fellow intern, Dennis Gant.

## Notes

* Doyle reads the hockey magazine Face/Off.
