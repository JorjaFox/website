She quoted some theory, she connected dots, and she was smart. Good Sara scenes. Not enough, but what can you do? Sara picked up on the shots being fired at Catherine's address, she found the bullets, she saw the cleanup job right away.

Apparently, like Sara's farewell letter which was written by Jorja, Marg wrote a lot of Catherine's speech. For me? Getting to hear a repeat of "King Kong on cocaine" brought cheers. That was always my favorite line.
