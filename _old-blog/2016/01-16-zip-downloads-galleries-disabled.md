The image gallery has allowed you to download zips for the last couple years. I love that feature. I know a lot of you do too. Someone ruined it for everyone, by scripting a bot that ran the download. And they were clever. They'd download 10, pause, change their IP, and do 10 more.

It's either a _very_ clever fan or someone's targeting the server. The problem with it is that the zip is saved to the server because it's generated on the fly, and they're constantly downloading and filling up the server. I'm guessing it's someone attacking, since a normal fan would download all the files and move on (about 10G). This person has done it 100 times, and nearly crashed the server twice today.

So I've disabled downloading the zips until I can find out how to stop this method of attack. Normally the server is really good about detecting those patterns and blocking them. I'll have to study up on that this weekend.

Sorry for the bummer folks. The images on JFO are, as always, free for you to use and reuse. All I ask is for a credit link back.
