Be The Change co-hosted the Update on the Gulf briefing, given by the Artists and Athletes Alliance and kindly posted a video.  Jorja's at the end.

**Jorja Fox:** ... and thought provoking and, I think, most importantly, most everybody who was here tonight I think left with a sense of like 'Hey I can do something about this.' and 'What can I do?' and 'What should I do tomorrow?' and that's really a sort of good feeling amidst a lot of horrible feelings.  It was awesome.

For more information on the event, visit Service Nation and be the change!

(Also don't forget Jorja's birthday fundraiser is open until September 1st, so there's still time to donate to help clean up the Gulf.  Visit <a href="https://jorjafox.net/birthday">https://jorjafox.net/birthday</a> and pass it on.)
