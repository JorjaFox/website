Let's not bury the lede. The reboot is now being pitched as a 'short' series (so think of it like a mini series or a more UK style series) wherein some of the old guard return and we would be introduced to the new set of CSI misfits and crime solvers.

As reported in February, CBS is developing a short-run _CSI_ revival that that would commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original series’ launch. _Elementary_ vet Jason Tracey is shepherding the project. The follow-up would once again be set in Las Vegas and, if deals can be made, feature a number of original cast members — but which ones?Sources confirm to TVLine that original stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox are in advanced talks to reprise their respective roles as Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle. Petersen and Fox would be surrounded by a new crop of _CSI_ characters. An insider cautions that CBS, which declined to comment for this story, has yet to formally order the project.
