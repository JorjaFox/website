## Synopsis

Nate Haskell, the Dick and Jane killer, tells Langston he knows who Dr. Jekyll is, and agrees to work with the CSIs to capture him, for a price. Using his information, that Jekyll was a chef, the CSIs track Jekyll to Venetti's, an Italian restaurant closed these last 5 years, where all his victims once ate and had their photos on the wall. After wheedling a steak dinner and a strip dance, Haskell gives them a name: Carlo Perinni. A fake name.

Jekyll plays cat and mouse with the CSIs, sending packages addressed to Ray, sent from his dead father, with more clues. They manage to track him down, however, using the clues and epithelial trace left on them, to DiMasa's, a restaurant owned by the former manager of Venetti's. Who happens to be Jekyll's father. Charlie DiMasa, aka Jekyll, has implanted a device in his father's chest to kill him, angry that his father never let him go to medical school.

While Charlie/Jekyll shoots a cop and Nick, and holds Ray and his father at gunpoint, Nate Haskell plays mind games with his guard. Ray stalls for time while Nick manages to reach his gun and shoots Jekyll. Nick survives with a minor shoulder wound, but the episode ends as Ray tells Haskell that Charlie is dead, and Haskell stabs him in the kidney.
