Jorja has asked us to please sign a petition to put a stop to new fossil fuel development.

{{< blockquote >}}
We call on world leaders to end all new fossil fuel development and transition to investing only in the 100% renewable technology that will power an end to energy poverty.

A new report from Oil Change International shows that operating coal, oil and gas projects contain enough carbon pollution to push the planet beyond the red lines of warming laid down in Paris. That means that keeping the Paris promise requires halting growth of the industry, and investing in 100% renewable energy for all.

Renewable energy can power the world, confront poverty and empower people. Governments must now put their Paris pledges into action -- and action means no more room for new fossil fuel projects.
