Meanwhile, Hodges questions his marriage plans to Elisabetta, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, May 1 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. Model Catrinel Menghia Marlon guest stars as Italian bombshell Elisabetta.

Somehow I don't think Hodges' wedding will go off as planned. Poor guy.

Just as an FYI, CBS has been going after the various places that usually post previews etc region free. So if I'm not posting them, that's why.
