<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3489" title="hunt-003" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/hunt-003-224x140.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="75" />After CBS has gone on the rampage, shutting down YouTube accounts for fansites, I've decided to re-vamp how <a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos">JFO Videos</a> are going to work.

First, there will be videos you just can't find elsewhere.  Exclusive videos (like the one I took at the Humane Society Gala), or just ones nigh impossible to find.  Those are all _self-hosted_ here on the server, and will be few and far between.  These will be viewable for all nations and while I generally will make them freely downloadable, I ask you **not** reproduce them on other sites.  Honor code, people.

Second, official videos that CBS (or whomever) post in ways I can embed into this site.  The catch to that is some of the videos won't be internationally viewable.  Thats up to the copyright holders of the videos and I _will not_ be breaking copyright.  Sorry guys, but when it comes down to 'Have videos for some or none at all' I had to go with the legal way of doing these things.

Finally, _CSI_ trailers/promos.  If Jorja's in 'em, I will do my best to get you unrestricted access.  No idea how that will pan out for next season, mind you.  Those will _not_ be listed on the video page, however.  They're just too transient in nature so they'll be posted on the main site.

So there you have it.  The <a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos">JFO Video</a> page is back up, with just a handful of videos right now.  I'm going through my old videos, trying to decide which ones I can post without retribution and which ones I certainly cannot.
