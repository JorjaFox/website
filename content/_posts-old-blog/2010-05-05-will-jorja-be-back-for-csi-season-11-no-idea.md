<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/05/season11-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="season11" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2380" /> As a gentle reminder, emailing me multiple times to ask 'Is Jorja coming back next season?' does not endear you to me. Once or twice, sure, but to the gentleman who sent me <strong>fifteen</strong> emails today, your email has been blocked for the time being.  I have a real job, and this isn't it, no matter how much I'd love to spend my time here all day!

Anyway. To the point, I don't know if Jorja will be back for Season 11. It's very likely she'll be back, at the very least, for the season premiere, as it's a to-be-continued from this season's finale.  However, as of April, there's been no contract negotiations at all between Jorja and CSI, so it's impossible for me to know.  After all, they have to ask her first, don't they?

If I get more speculation, I'll comment in this post, but I suspect we're not going to find out till end of July.
