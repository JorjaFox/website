They have a gap between their two front teeth.  Well, now runways all over the world are sporting models with the gap, and it's winning hearts and attention.  Even on popular TV Reality shows, people are sporting their differences loud and proud.  Beauty doesn't have to be the same for everyone, and it's about time magazines and the industry are recognizing that.

<blockquote>"I think for so long the look was cookie-cutter beauty, and it doesn't stand out," says Heather Muir, beauty news editor for Allure magazine in New York. "We're shifting to a more quirky beauty, and I think that includes women who have very fair skin, many freckles, or frizzy, big hair."</blockquote>

What about you?  Does Jorja's gap enhance or detract from her style for you?
