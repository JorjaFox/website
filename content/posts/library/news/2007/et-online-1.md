Another ongoing storyline this season has been the secret romance between Grissom and Sara Sidle (**JORJA FOX**). Because of that, Thea, who watched as Billy Petersen interrupted her interview with Marg to plant a big kiss on his co-star's mouth, had to ask where he sees his on-screen romance going.

"Grissom and Sara have had a relationship for a while," he points out. "We don't know for how long and in what way, but they have, obviously, had a relationship for a long time. It is interesting for me to be able to play the character and have this be a part of it. It has been fun for me to work with Jorja in that way and with the writers, too. What should we show? How secret can they be and get away with it? My character doesn't want [their relationship] revealed to anyone ever, so I am not going to cheat and tell."
