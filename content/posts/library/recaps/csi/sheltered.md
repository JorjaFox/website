## Synopsis

When a young camper, Carl Abrams, is stalked and slain in a remote area populated by Doomsday Preppers, the team investigates an underground bunker that holds several shocking surprises. Carl was dumped by an underpass by a man wearing night vision goggles, and died from having one of his hands cut off (the other was cut off anti-mortem). His leg had also been ripped apart by a bear trap. Carl was fond of camping around the mines near where the Doomsday Preppers lived.

The CSIs find a hidden bunker out by the mines with the help of Nick's dog, Sam, where traces of Carl's blood laces the stairs. A Prepper, Tommy, is found when they investigate, and while his room in the bunker is utilitarian, he has a second bedroom for a girl, or a women. The CSIs find a girl, Miranda, hiding in the air vents. Trace evidence on the dresses lead them to an unsolved murder of Rebecca Barnes, 11 years ago, in Carson City. Rebecca was Tommy's wife, and Miranda is their daughter.

While Tommy was out working odd jobs, Miranda was 'entertaining' boys, one of whom was the dead Carl Abrams. The other was Luke Holland, who worked at the local supply store. Luke claims he didn't kil Carl, but he found the body after hooking up with Miranda, so he dumped the body. Luke also explained that Miranda didn't cheat on him with Carl, Carl and *his* boyfriend were using the bed for their of hookups. Carl's boyfriend was his best friend, Dylan Trigg.

It was Dylan's father who hunted down and killed Carl out of homophobia.

## Review

Sara and Finn investigate the bunker together and find both the girl's room as well as guns and the girl, Miranda. She also worked on the video, finding the body dump, and found Carl's hand in the desert.

## Notes

* Sara is pretty blas√© picking up Carl's hand.
