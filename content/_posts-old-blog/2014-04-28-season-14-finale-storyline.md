CBS announced today the story-lines for this season's finales, and while they tout cliffhangers and excitement, the release for CSI is a little bland:
<blockquote><strong>WEDNESDAY, MAY 7</strong>

<strong>CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION (10:00-11:00 PM)</strong>

The CSIs investigate a present-day crime with ties to a mob heist that occurred 25 years ago, and Brass has to make a decision when his daughter attempts suicide. Treat Williams guest stars.</blockquote>

So. We already knew that.

At least they look like they had fun!
