In an interview with TVGuide.com:

> **TVGuide.com: Since Petersen remains an executive producer, did he come in and watch the filming? Did he seem like he was itching to get back in front of the camera?**
>
> **Friedkin:** He came down for two or three days, yeah. [...]
>
> I think he'll do a few [more episodes] as he said he would. I think if they can craft some special stories for him... I think Jorja [Fox] will as well. [...]
