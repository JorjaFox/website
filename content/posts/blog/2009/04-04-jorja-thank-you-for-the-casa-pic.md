Everyone remembers that awesome <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/albums/personal/jorja/advocacy/20081009-casa/casa_01.jpg">Giant CASA Check</a>.  And how we all said that it had to be taken during Grissom's last episode? Well, we were right, and Jorja wishes we'd been there too.  Because that's how cool she is!

From Jorja to you:
<blockquote>Hello everybody,

I finally, was able to muster this photo out of tptb at CBS. The presentation happened with very little fanfare and was a complete surprise to me the day that it actually did happen. I'm so sorry it's so long in coming and I wanted to thank all of you so very much for your endurance, support, utter coolness, and gigantic generosity in making the CASA donation possible.

We picked CASA because Sara Sidle was a foster kid. It was Carol M's idea and I thought it was a perfect place to land all the wishes and hopes from all of you on Sara's behalf.

As a side note it was the day of that, for now, last scene between Sara and Grissom tucked away in the Costa Rican rain forest.........Very fitting although I wish some of you had been there to give over that literally enormous check. I guess I have to suffice that you were all there in spirit as you have always been.

With deepest thanks for sharing your world with me as well as your strength, beauty, and friendship.

Jorja
