From Shane:
<blockquote>CBS will announce its upfront presentation on May 13 (afternoon EST). You can expect an announcement for CSI that day (possibly sooner).</blockquote>
I'm really nervous. I don't want to lose my show. I have no idea how it's going to go. A lot of this hinges on how well CSI: Cyber's been doing. The ratings started dropping, so it might be a split choice. Either Cyber or Mothership.

I would hope that CBS wouldn't be so assy as to not give them a final season but unlike the <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/04/21/cbs-predictions-the-good-wife-is-likely-to-be-renewed/390271/">Cancellation Bear</a>, I just have hope and a wish.
