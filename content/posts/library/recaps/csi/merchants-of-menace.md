## Synopsis

The CSI team investigates a homicide at a convention for people who collect macabre murder memorabilia. Morgan Brody and D.B. Russell are first on the scene to investigate a man found dead in the car at his own own convention. Damon Harlow, a student of the psychology of serial killers, was dating the sister of a victim of the killer whose car he was found dead in.

Damon was found dead in the car of Lucas Reem, the killer who'd killed Nora Water's sister, stabbed to death by a bone from Lucas, sharpened into a blade. Bruce Waters, Nora's father, was killed by the same man who killed Damon. The killer was wearing Lucas Reem's fringed leather jacket for both crimes.

It turns out one of the young kids at the convention was the killer.

## Review

Sara interviews Nora Waters and goes with Nick to try and catch Bruce Waters before he's able to buy Lucas Reems' bones.

## Notes

* One of the models from the Miniature Crime Scene killer is used by Nick to gain entry in a memorabilia back alley meeting.
