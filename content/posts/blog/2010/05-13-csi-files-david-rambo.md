Kristine Huntley of <a href="http://csifiles.com">CSI Files</a> got the chance to talk to David Rambo about this season (and next).  There was a brief mention of Jorja:

<blockquote>**CSI Files: Jorja Fox** has been in quite a few episodes this season. Any chance Sara Sidle will be back in the lab full time next season?

**Rambo:** I don’t know the answer to that one. But hasn’t it been great to see her back this season?</blockquote>
