## Synopsis

Two Daddy's girls pay high prices when their worlds invite murder and mayhem.

Bianca Desmond, daughter of 'Gas & Sip' king, Happy Harry Desmond, lives with her boyfriend Ahren, who is found dead in her garage after a night of partying with Bianca and Chelsea Wannamaker. Bianca demonstrates a bit of a cleaning jag, prompting the CSIs to suspect she's a speed freak. Chelsea claims they only use drugs recreationally. A drop of blood was found in the bedroom, but it doesn't match Ahren or Bianca, and a bullet is found in a soda can in the garage.

The blood _does_ match Justin Cole, a meth-using ex of Bianca's. He finds it funny that Ahren was shot at, because he too was shot in the knee and chased away from Bianca. The soda-can bullet happens to match one found in the knee of Bianca's meth-head ex-boyfriend. Since it looks like Ahren fought back, the CSIs determine he managed to avoid the gun, only to be stabbed in the femoral artery, bleeding out in minutes. The bullet, however, is copper, and doesn't help with matching it to anything on a database. The garage is well organized, and Warrick finds one screwdriver that doesn't match anything. The screwdriver belongs to Tom Harper, who installed DSL and provides the work order.

The main shocker is that Chelsea is Bianca's mother and Happy Harry her father. Chelsea had slept with Ahren and Bianca had found out, but the couple had made up and decided to move to Colorado. Harry, on the other hand, is surprised to find that Chelsea was cheating on him, with Ahren. All of Harry's guns are checked and none match. Chelsea has a gun, but claims it had been stolen earlier that month.

When the CSIs go to talk to Bianca about guns, they find her bloddied and beaten in her home. At the ER, after Sara chases out Bianca's parents, Bianca says Sara shouldn't have taken away her father's innocence, regarding her mother's infidelity. Sara says that whomever beat up Bianca is the killer, and Bianca should stop trying to protect her family. But Bianca won't.

The CSIs review the evidence. The substance found on Bianca's neck (in the ER) is found on railroad ties and telephones poles. Tom Harper's DSL work order was for a Sunday. Sara tests the paper and determines the order has been counterfeited. This leads her to examine phone records and find that Bianca had some serious overlap with her three boyfriends: Tom, Justin, and Ahren.

In an interview, Tom admits that he had been tapping Bianca's phone line, to keep an eye on her and protect her. He also says that Chelsea had asked him to scare off Justin. Tom tried to scare off Ahren when he overheard Bianca telling her father she wanted to moved to Colorado with Ahren. Only the shot went wide, and when Tom kicked at Ahren's groin, his pole-climbing spike punctured Ahren's aterey. Both he and Chelsea are charged with murder.

Meanwhile, Catherine and Nick work a case that harkens back to Walter Gordon (from "Grave Danger"), the man who buried Nick alive. Accountant Sylvia Mullins is killed by her own car, pinned against the wall. The security guard had been asleep, and the camera had been turned out of focus an hour before. This sets the crime as a homicide, and no simple hit-and-run. While going through Sylvia's belongings, Nick finds that she was working with Kelly Gordon, Walter's daughter.

Nick interviews Kelly, and determines that Sylvia was the trustee to Walter's estate. He accuses her of murder, and she claims innocence. As Nick reviews the case, he finds the new evidence Grissom logged in "Bodies in Motion". Nick confronts Archie on the evidence, and though angry, asks Archie to see if Kelly is the second voice on the tape. It turns out the voice is Sylvia's. Also, the hand that unfocused the security camera was Kelly's and Sylvia was possibly embezzling from her clients.

Kelly Gordon is arrested and confesses. She killed Sylvia because the ransom plot was Sylvia's idea. Sylvia had also taken the money from the Gordon estate. As the episode ends, Kelly is ODing on handfuls of meds, and her death is uncertain though likely.

## Review

After talking to Bianca in the ER, Sara notices the substance on her skin and snaps up the nurse's gloves. It's this evidence that leads them to look at Tom closer and eventually find the killer. While Sara is more subdued than normal with an abuse case, she still shows her strong distaste in those situations.

## Notes

* Sara still reacts strongly to rape and abuse cases, where women are victimized.

## Quotes

**Sara:** _(looking at Grissom)_ I guess some people just shouldn't be together.
