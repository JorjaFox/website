Looks like they're going to do a 10-week straight on run at this rate!

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">“Let the Chips Fall” – As Grissom and Sara close in on who framed Hodges, the CSI team investigates a lock room murder mystery at 30,000 feet, when a cargo plane lands autonomously at McCarran Airport and everyone on board has been killed, on CSI: VEGAS, Wednesday, Nov. 3 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+.</blockquote>

Oh and yes there are photos this time:
