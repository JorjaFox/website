Remember when JAA was raising money for the ADI lions and we were helping?  Well, they said<a href="http://jorjaallaround.livejournal.com/690712.html"> thank you</a> to JAA (which means to us too!) and wondered if you guys would be interested in buying your very own lion?

Don't worry, you won't need a super sized litter box!  All you have to do is fill out the adoption form you'll find below that ADI kindly sent JAA (and they shared with me). Just include your name, phone number, address, desired donation amount, and a few other details, and your money will go straight to ADI and will directly benefit the newly-rescued lions. Your donation will also come with an adoption pack consisting of an adoption certificate, a DVD, and also their adoption newsletter "Toto News" which is only sent 3 times a year.
