If a pilot dies in a squirrel suit but Sara's only in one scene, will anyone watch?

Sara's in one scene where Morgan bounces her Columbian Drug Cartel theory off her (bzzzz totally wrong) and that's it. The episode was pretty good, though. I liked the various wrong theories and such, and the science. Just a bummer to only get one scene with Sara.
