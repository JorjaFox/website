_Fans of LeFox_ (or ‘the site’) refers to this website and other related domains and subdomains thereof.

There are two segments of this site that directly relate to privacy concerns: Data Collection and Data Usage

## Data Collection

Like most website operators, _Fans of LeFox_ collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. _Fans of LeFox_'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

_Fans of LeFox_ also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information other than to identify visitors, and we do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below:

**Comments:** When visitors leave comments on the website, the collected data shown in the comments form, as well as the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string are saved in order to help prevent abuse and aid in spam detection.

**Cookies:** Visitors who leave a comment on this site may opt in to saving their name, email address, and website in cookies. These are for convenience so that they do not have to fill in your details again when they leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using this website, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

For additional details regarding cookie consent notices, please refer to [cookiechoices.org](https://cookiechoices.org)

**Mailing Lists:** Visitors who chose to register for a double-opt-in email list will receive emails when new content on the site is published. This service is provided by Automattic (via Jetpack) and is subject to Automattic’s Privacy Policy. If visitors do not wish to be tracked then they should not register for an email subscription.

**Aggregated Statistics:** This site collects and may share statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, it may reveal how many visits a particular page got. Personal and identifying information will _not_ be revealed to the public.

### 3rd Party Services

Third party vendors are used to provide additional services, such as spam protection, ads, and analytics. These vendors often use cookies to serve content (such as ads) based on a user’s prior visits to this website or other websites, as well as track visits. Visitors may opt out of these vendor’s use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting [AboutAds.info](https://www.aboutads.info) or directly with the vendor via their website.

The following services are used:

* Google Analytics

In addition, articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor interaction with that embedded content, including tracking interaction with the embedded content if a visitor has an account and are logged in to that website.

## Data Usage

The purpose in collecting information is to better understand how visitors use this site.

Protection: The primary use of data collected from visitors is for site protection. As a website that is dedicated to documentation of a public person, there is a high probability of abusive intent by visitors. Be it people who don’t like Jorja Fox, or people who do not like her roles, due to their abusive behaviour we track commenters.

**Retention:** If a visitor leaves a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so future comments can be recognized and approved automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. 3rd Party services (listed above) retain data per their terms.

**Requisition:** Visitors who have left comments on this website or contacted the site via a contact form may request to receive an export file of the personal data held, including any data provided directly. Visitors can also request that we delete any personal data held. This does not include any data kept for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Requests for data and it’s deletion may be sent to `webmaster@jorjafox.net`
