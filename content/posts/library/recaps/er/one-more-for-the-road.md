## Summary

Mark, still recovering from the attack, vents his emotions in a violent fit in the break room and buys a gun for protection. Carter decides his future lies in emergency medicine, not surgery, and tries to convince an irate Anspaugh likewise. Drs. Ross and Del Amico work together when Charlie is brought back into the ER. Peter's child strengthens. Doug and Carol share a kiss. Jeanie and Al are back together.

## Review

Doyle approves of Mark's choice in guns: a Sig Sauer. She later works with him on an athlete with a coronary problem who's having chest pains.
