While you have a lot of options on how to keep warm, there are animals who've had one hell of a year.  With the California fires, the animals over at <a href="http://www.animalacres.org/">Animal Acres</a> need our help more than ever.

So this Holiday Season, I'm running a fundraiser, but I'm doing it differently. Instead of you giving ME the money via paypal, we're going to do it via Crowdrise.  Crowdrise deducts 5% on donations made through their site and a $1 transaction fee for donations under $25 or a $2.50 transaction fee for donations $25 and over. The break point starts around $100, and while it's certainly taking MORE than PayPal does in most cases, it's available for people who don't have PayPal accounts! I know that's always been a factor for folks.

<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-animalacres2010/"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/11/crowdrise.jpg" alt="" title="crowdrise" width="388" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2683" /></a>

Go to **<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-animalacres2010/">http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-animalacres2010/</a>** and donate by **January 15, 2011**.  I set the goal of $500 kind of arbitrarily, based on the last couple fundraisers.  If we make it, great! If not? Hey, we still did something!  Don't stress on that one too much.

If you want to join the fundraising team and help spread the word, let me know!

PS: If you're the sort of person who cares about getting free stuff for donating, Crowdrise has some cool <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/give/promotions">Promotions</a>.
