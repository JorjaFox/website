Updated: The overnights are in and it doesn't look good. But it doesn't look bad. EVERYTHING was down in the ratings, and while CSI won the hour, they had their worst ratings ever. I mean EVER.

AllAboutMarg nabbed the trailer and preview for "Irradiator", which will air 10pm on April 8th.

Yeah, 10pm.

Oh and CBS yanked the video down.  My guess is _either_ they just want to wait till Friday, like normal, or they aren't 100% sold on the 10pm thing.  We'll have to see.
