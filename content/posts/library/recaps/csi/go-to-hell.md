## Synopsis

As the weather breaks 110+ in Las Vegas, deaths are more common but less common place. A homeless man dies in an alley, a married couple are killed in a seedy hotel room, and a bee dies in mid-flight.

The couple in the hotel room were killed by their 12 year-old daughter, who they thought was possessed by a devil, and kept her locked in an attic room much of the time. After hiring a local minister who specialized in exorcism, the father had second thoughts and freed his daughter, who hooked up with an older man she'd met online. After having sex with him, she killed her parents and her younger sister. The minister, who earlier had been preaching to the poor masses of Las Vegas that they were in hell, finds the 12 year-old and throws her off a balcony, killing her and completing the exorcism.

## Review

Sara works the case of the dead homeless man, who died after getting in a fight with another bum over a sandwich, and was briefly detained by the police. Sara questions the police officer involved, who says he didn't bring the man in because he thought it was a ploy by the homeless man to get some AC in the heat. Sadly, the man died of exposure.

Working the swing shift, Sara's new partner is the rookie, Ronnie Lake, who annoys Sara with endless questions, very few of which are pertinent to the case. The questions prompt Sara to institute a 20 questions a case rule. Sara cracks down on the rookie when she wonders if it's right to consider the police as suspects. Sara also misses her friends on the night shift, and is very pleased to talk to Brass and Greg when she sees them.

Once Sara is off the clock, she goes and visits Grissom at his crime scene, where he's stealing bees (with permission). She comments on something she read about the deaths of bees, and Grissom corrects her. At this point, Sara is still wearing a sling, but no large (or visible) cast, and most of her facial injuries have healed.

## Notes

* Sara takes her frustrations out on the rookie.
* Sara does not appear to be enjoying her time on swing shift.
* Sara comments on the deaths of bees and what it means to the world.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Ronnie, I'm going to have to limit you to twenty questions per case.

- - -

**Lake** Oh, you're not seriously going to go after the cops over something like this.
**Sara:** You know, I'm going to answer that question. We're not here to protect anyone Ronnie, not even cops. We're here to figure out what happened. If you can't do that, you should get a different job.
