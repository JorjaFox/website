I enjoyed the episode. It was funny, it was entertaining, and Sara was both smart _and _the voice of reason. Her and Finn at the end was great.

That said. What the _hell _happened to Sara's brother? You all remember <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/One-hit_Wonder">One-hit Wonder</a> (season three):
<blockquote>When I was a kid I was playing hide-and-seek one day and I found this plastic bag under my big brother's bed. I thought it was a bag of dirt so I took it to my mom. Turned out it was his bag of weed. He was grounded for a year.</blockquote>
Now this is the only time the brother is mentioned as a brother, however later on in Season five, it's implied she has _a _sibling. I'm sure you're not shocked to know I have a wiki page for "<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Sara_Sidle%27s_Older_Brother">Sara Sidle's Older Brother</a>."
