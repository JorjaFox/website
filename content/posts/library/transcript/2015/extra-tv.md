## On the Set of 'CSI'! All the Scoop on the Series Finale  

*'Crime Watch Daily' host Matt Doran was the perfect 'Extra' special correspondent to stop by the 'CSI' set to get the scoop on the series finale. Watch!

Catch the final episode Sept. 27 at 9 PM on CBS.

**Matt Doran:** Oh yeah!

**Jorja Fox:** Thank you.
