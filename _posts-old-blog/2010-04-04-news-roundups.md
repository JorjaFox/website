<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/03dysfunctional-couples-csi2.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/03dysfunctional-couples-csi2-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="03dysfunctional-couples-csi2" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2342" /></a> Michael Ausiello (from EW.com) says that a Grissom cameo this season is "<a href="http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/03/31/ask-ausiello-true-blood-lost-glee/">logistically impossible</a>."

The Rumor Rat has spies that report CSI gets two more seasons and there are some other rumors about Marg leaving and someone else (male) in peril.

TVGuide.com thinks that Grissom and Sara should be on the list for <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/TVs-Dysfunctional-Couples-1016443/1016445">TV's Most Dysfunctional Couples</a>.

And, finally, the most important question: WHEN is CSI airing this week?  The answer is an unconfirmed **9pm Eastern (8 Central)**.  That Jorja's in it is the only thing I _can_ confirm.  I'll be watching at 9pm.
