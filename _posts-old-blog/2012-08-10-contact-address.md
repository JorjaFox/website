If you're trying to get in touch with Jorja, to send her a card, or a package, the addresses have changed. She's using Studio Fan Mail now, probably due to the volume of mail y'all send her. So please, let's all respect this change and only use these addresses.

For Postal Mail only:

<dl><dd>STUDIO FAN MAIL
P.O. BOX 3175
BIG BEAR CITY, CA 92314</dd></dl>For UPS, FedEx, DHL, and all other courier services:

<dl><dd>STUDIO FAN MAIL
