## Synopsis

Season Finale. The CSIs investigate when the body of an unidentified young woman is discovered stuffed in an overturned shopping cart near a freeway underpass. Her horribly disfigured and partially decomposed face is a nightmare of blood, scabs and scars, as if she'd been shoved into a fan. A huge circular hole dominates her left cheek. Someone not only wanted her dead, Grissom reasons, but 'they wanted her ugly.' Adding to the mystery are the cart's other contents: an expensive handbag, fashion magazines and a leather day planner with notes written in code.

## Notes

* Sara is good with codes and puzzles.
* Once again Sara shows her obsession with a case, taking all night to crack the code in the day planner.

## Quotes

**Sara:** I got crabs.
**Grissom:** Excuse me?
**Sara:** I got crabs _(points at the microscope)_ Take a look.
