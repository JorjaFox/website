**CSI Files:** There"s word that Gil Grissom will somehow factor into the episode. Will there be an appearance by William Petersen before the end of the season?

**Pokaski:** I can"t speak to the end of the season (or I might not make it past it myself), but part of Wednesday night"s story is dedicated to understanding Married life between Sara [Sidle, Jorja Fox] and Grissom. How it works, and why it works. And the last image in that sub-story makes me smile every time I see it.
