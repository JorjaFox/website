Don't expect to see Jorja on Jimmy Fallon's _The Tonight Show_ any time soon.

Jorja, along with Bob Barker, Kim Basinger, Kristin Bauer van Straten, Ross McCall and Lily Tomlin, have joined the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) in petitioning _The Tonight Show_ to stop using wild and exotic animal acts on the show.

The letter is embedded below.
