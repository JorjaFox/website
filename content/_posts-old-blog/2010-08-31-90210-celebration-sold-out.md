If you wanted to go to 9.02.10 to cheer Jorja on for winning an award, the general tickets to this Thursday night's 9.02.10 Celebration Event have sold out and the VIP tickets are almost gone!

Not really surprising when you think about where the event is.  VIP tickets are $199 for the over 21 crowd, and if you're in town and have the cash, go buy a ticket.

The schedule has the Humane Society of US Award Presentation to Wendie Malick, Kaley Cuoco and Jorja Fox set for 8:45pm.
