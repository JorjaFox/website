After changing the <em>CSI</em> Christmas Episode, twice, they finally canceled it and are doing <em>Blue Bloods</em> and <em>Hawaii 5-O</em> instead tomorrow night. Which is fine by me, I'll be watching <em>Doctor Who</em> (the series, not the <em>CSI</em> episode). Still, January 15th is the next **new** episode, and yes, Sara's in it.
