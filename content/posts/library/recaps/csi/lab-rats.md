## Synopsis

This episode revolves around the tertiary characters of the CSI lab: Archie, Hodges, Henry, Mandy and Wendy. After Grissom assigns out all the CSIs and goes to the morgue to work with Doc Robbins, Hodges collects the other 'lab rats' to go over the miniature crime scenes. Implying that Grissom has asked him to work on the case, Hodges leads the other techs through the crimes and the history.

_Note: This episode originally titled 'While the Cat's Away'_

## Review

Sara handles a pickup from the CDC, where an outbreak of herpes 1 has run rampant through the office. On her return, Sara talks to one of the lab techs, who asks Sara if the miniatures are keeping Grissom up at night, and if Grissom would confide in Hodges.

## Notes

* Sara is quick to deny knowing how Grissom spends his nights when asked.
