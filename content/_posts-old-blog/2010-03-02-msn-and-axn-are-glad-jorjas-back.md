First off, they need a better editor, since Jorja hasn't been gone four years, and it's Grissom, not Griffith, but whatever.

<blockquote><strong>Q: What’s the best thing about being Jorja Fox right now?

A:</strong> I think the best thing is things could be a lot worse. I’m a very lucky person. I was able to take a year off which was a very terrifying risk and when I was done with my year off, the people I love and admired who I worked with for so long welcomed me back as if I never left. That’s a really nice feeling. They took me in their arms and told me let’s go to work.

<strong>Q: What’s the worst thing about being you right now?

A: </strong>The worst thing is we had some crazy weather over here and the hardest thing about filming is not knowing whether we will be filming in the rain or freezing cold temperature.</blockquote>
