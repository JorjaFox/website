_<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2015/paley-center-farewell-date-change/">NOTICE! THE DATE HAS CHANGED TO SEPTEMBER 16TH</a>_

Thursday, September 17, the Paley Center will have an exclusive screening and special farewell salute panel.

<a href="http://media.paleycenter.org/paleyfest-fall-tv-previews-2015">Special Event: CSI Farewell Salute</a> begins at 7pm with a screening.

Here are the confirmed attendees from the cast:

* William Petersen, “Gil Grissom”
* Marg Helgenberger, “Catherine Willows”
* Ted Danson, “D.B. Russell”
* Jorja Fox, “Sara Sidle”

You can buy tickets tomorrow if you're a member (I'm not) at <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=6073505&pl=paley">ticketweb</a>.

The rest of us? Well we have to wait until the 31st at 9am PT. Tickets are $30 a person and that includes the reception, panel, and screenings. The event is up in Beverley Hills and, yes, I'm going to try and go.

Can't go? _Everything_ will be streamed on Yahoo.

I have to admit, this moment is when it all sunk in for me. God. It's almost all over.

ETA: CitiCard members should be able to buy tickets on Tuesday.
