## Synopsis

In a twist to the normal CSI format, this episode was told from two perspectives: that of the CSIs and that of the killers.

Karl 'Red' Cooper is a former bank robber and thief who served time when his former friend, Clayton Nash, finked on him and a bunch of their fellow criminals. Karl shoots and kills Clayton in retribution, after Nash contacts him as a part of the 12-step process to cure one's self of dependency. As Karl makes his escape, meticulous enough to not even leave a stray cigarette butt, he is broadsided by a drunk young woman named Ally Sullivan. Hoping to avoid the police, Karl tries to talk Ally out of calling them, but she does so anyway. Or at least she starts to, when Karl breaks her neck, leaving her for dead.

Back at home, Karl shaves his beard and tries to keep it secret from his wife, Janice, who knows of his bank robber past and the reason he served time. Karl follows the case of Ally via the television and feels some measure of guilt for the death of an innocent. He goes so far as to leave cash for Ally's father, by way of apology. When he feels the CSIs are getting close, Karl asks his lawyer (who is a lawyer for many former and current criminals) for supplies from which Karl can forge a new identity. Janice finds these and confronts Karl, who admits to killing Nash. While Janice understands the killing of Nash, she is horrified that Karl killed Ally and kicks him out. The next day, the CSIs come to Janice's home and threaten to take away their daughter. Upon finding this out, Karl turns himself in.

As for the CSIs, they appear to play catch-up for much of the case. They have little evidence, and it's not until they find matching fibers on Ally and Nash that they're able to link the cases and determine the killer. The car leads them to a used car lot where a blurry photocopy of Karl is their only lead. Checking the bus routes, they find the bus driver who recognizes Karl, and gives the stop he boarded the bus from. That stop turns out to be on an ATV route, where the CSIs find a burnt pile of clothes, including the gloves which left fibers at Ally and Nash's crime scene. The ATV tracks are particular enough to lead the CSIs to Janice. Also, the palm print Karl left on Ally's car links them to him, and the same last name between Janice and Karl is enough for a warrant, especially since Karl's record lists Janice, under her maiden name, as a visitor in prison.

## Review

There is very little character development in this episode, as the majority of the story is told from Karl's perspective. Sara's best work comes when she tracks the bus routes that may have taken Karl to where he bought the car, which turns up a very attentive bus driver.
