Jorja Fox (who can't keep her mouth shut on TV's CSI.) has the dialogue-free part of Shelby's murdered wife. It seems like the wife ought to be the most important role. It seems also that this role was cast haphazardly, but maybe the problem is that Nolan didn't create a more poignant sense of lost marital love.

When it goes Rashamonic and metaphysical at the disappointing end of the story, Memento gropes for a broader significance it doesn't earn. Sliced in a new direction, Memento is still the same old B-movie baloney. Only an audience of amnesiacs would find it completely groundbreaking.
