<blockquote>Juliette West and Jorja Fox (CSI star and HIBE producer) spoke at a free family screening of the movie How I Became An Elephant in Roosevelt Park on August 3, 2013, the second annual Elephant Awareness Day. The event was sponsored by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and drew about 200 viewers including many children.</blockquote>
