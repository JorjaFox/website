Hi Shane!

Look! <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2015/megabuzz-dies/" title="MegaBuzz: Who Dies?">She's still alive!</a> They don't wrap filming till Friday, though.

I don't know if we'll get many (any) more snippits from behind the scenes this episode, seeing as it's a cliffhanger.

And of course, they're still filming into the night:
