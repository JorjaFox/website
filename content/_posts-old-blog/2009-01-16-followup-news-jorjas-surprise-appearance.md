And now a collection of news sites reporting on what we always knew. Jorja was on CSI last night.

<blockquote>Sappy sendoff? Perhaps. Satisfying? You bet [...] I don't know if these two characters will go on to get hitched -- hell, I don't even know if they'll make it out of that jungle -- but this is exactly the payoff I wanted if I were going to have to accept a <em>CSI</em> without Petersen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When Fox left "CSI" last season, Shankar and executive producer Carol Mendelsohn always intended to bring her back for Grissom's exit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The departure of William Petersen's character from in front of the camera was mapped out in long conversations between two of the show's two executive producers, Petersen and co-star Jorja Fox, according to Carol Mendelsohn, one of the showrunners on "CSI," who has been overseeing production of the show since episode one.</blockquote>
