## Synopsis

The swing shift has a busy time. Warrick looks into the murder of man by someone who apparently needs a wheelchair. Nick looks into the murder of woman in the subculture of the narcocorrido, songs about drug murders. The night shift is slow and lends help to Catherine's team.

## Notes

* Even though Sara told Ecklie it was already done in "Mea Culpa", she only now has her post PEAP talk with Grissom.
* Sara moved to Vegas because of Grissom.
* Sara blames herself for the complications in her relationship with Grissom.
* Sara thinks of Grissom as more than just her boss.

## Quotes

**Sara:** We really haven't had a chance to talk since the staff changes. _sits down_ I, uh ... I wanted to let you know that I said some things to Ecklie that might have done the team a disservice.
**Grissom:** Ecklie wanted to break up the team and he did.
**Sara:** He asked me if you and I had had our post-PEAP counseling session.
**Grissom:** And we didn't. Regardless, you should never have to cover for your boss. I'm sorry.
**Sara:** You've always been a little more than a boss to me. _smiles at Grissom_ Why do you think I moved to Vegas? Look, I know our relationship has been complicated. It's probably my fault. It's probably definitely my fault.
**Grissom:** You, uh, completed your counseling, right?
**Sara:** Yeah. Yes.
**Grissom:** And ... ?
**Sara:** Let's just say that ... I sometimes ... I look for validation in inappropriate places.
:(They lapse into silence.)
**Grissom:** Look ... let's, um ...
:(More silence.)
**Sara:** It's okay. Okay. You know what, we did our session. Don't forget to document this for Ecklie. _smiles_
**Grissom:** Right.
**Sara:** Thanks. _stands up and leaves_
