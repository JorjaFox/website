CBS has axed "CSI" stars George Eads and Jorja Fox for demanding more money to stay on the show.

Eads and Fox, who played Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle, were fired by CBS for breach of contract. Eads failed to show up for work Thursday, the first day of filming for the new season and was fired soon after. Jorja was understood have been sent a letter of termination on Wednesday, according to published reports.

Both actors had been with the show since its inception in 2000.

CBS execs declined to comment yesterday.

While a search is underway for their replacements, it is not known how the show's creators will handle the sudden cast change. CBS officials would not say if they would recast the characters or develop new ones.

Many in the TV industry were shocked by CBS' no-nonsense treatment of Eads and Fox, who had starred for years on the TV's top-rated drama.

Industry sources said CBS brass were determined to send a message to the acting community because of the growing number of TV stars who have refused to return to work until they get raises.

In the last few years a slew of familiar faces from prime time have famously dug in their heels and refused to show up for work until their contracts were renegotiated.

James Gandolfini reportedly came close to shutting down "The Sopranos" for good in 2003 when he renegotiated his big-bucks deal with the show, and the cast of "West Wing" has been embroiled in several high-profile salary negotiations over the years.

Other high profile hold-outs included "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Brad Garrett, who plays sad-sack older brother Robert Barone. The move was said to have infuriated CBS execs, who eventually were able to settle the dispute with more money.
