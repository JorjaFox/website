So it's not great surprise that there was not a lot of Sara (or Greg for that matter). Sara was in a lot last week, she was not this week. She also has the next week off, because she was in Hawaii for ADI when they were filming. No wild theories needed!

</ul>
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is that.

Oh? How did I like the episode? I hate rape cases. Seriously. This is the first time since Sara's been back (so about 6 years now) that I've had to pay attention to the plot of a rape case. I'm glad that I was able to tune it out. The triple filming explains why they brought in the Swing and Day Shifters, too. I am wondering why they're cramming in so many episodes at once, though.
