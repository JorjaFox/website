Speaking of "CSI", former regular cast member Jorja Fox is now able to enjoy doing the other things she was raring to sink her teeth into when she decided to leave the show earlier this season. Since quitting as CSI Sara Sidle, Fox has had the opportunity to work on one of her dream projects.

"I'm producing a musical about the life and music of Dusty Springfield called "Stay Forever" in Los Angeles at the Renberg theater," Fox told Variety. "If you like Dusty's music, you will love this show."

"Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield" kicked off at the Renberg Theater in Los Angeles on February 7. It is a one-woman show featuring 13 of Springfield's songs, including hits like "Son of a Preacher Man" and "Wishin and Hopin'". Fox became part of the project through Kirsten Holly Smith, who essays the role of Springfield in the musical.

"I've always been a big fan of Dusty Springfield," Fox told the Lesbian News. "Even many years ago I read her story and found it interesting. I wanted to turn it into a screenplay. Kirsten, who I've known for years, called me and told me she was doing this show about Dusty Springfield. I was like, 'Wow, ain't that a small world.' So I went to see the show. I felt instantly in love. It was stunning, magical, and breathtaking. So I offered to get on board and now I'm the latest on this party train."

Fox's "CSI" co-stars, William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) attended the premiere of "Stay Forever", which is slated through February 23.
