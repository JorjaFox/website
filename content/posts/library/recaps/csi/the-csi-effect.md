## Synopsis

A notorious serial slayer, brought to justice by Russell and Finn years ago, faces imminent execution -- until a cunning copycat casts his guilt into serious doubt -- and casts a shadow over Russell's previous investigation.

The Gig Harbor Killer, Jared Briscoe, murdered 7 college students and staged his last three crime scenes to look like CSI had already been there.

## Review

Sara and Nick process the primary crime scene, with Sara working the blood. Later she processes the missing PI's car and finds the intentionally left blood 'spatter' on the ceiling.

## Notes

* Sara processes the car, which she has regularly done for all 15 seasons
