"**CSI" adds new cast member**

Jessica Lucas is joining the cast of CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" as a recurring.

She will play Veronica Lake, aka Ronnie, a young, vivacious, smart, sought-after newbie CSI in training who gets multiple job offers but chooses to go to Las Vegas because of the increase in crime rates there.

Ever since the role cropped up on breakdowns around town, it prompted speculation that the character might be groomed as a replacement for Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who was left crushed under a car with her hand barely moving in the Season 7 finale.

It is understood that Veronica is designed as a new addition to the team, not a replacement for Sara.

Lucas' credits include features "The Covenant" and "She's the Man" and the ABC series "Life as We Know It." She will next be seen in J.J. Abrams' feature "Cloverfield" for Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema's "Amusement."

Lucas is repped by the Gersh Agency and Thruline Entertainment.
