CSI STARS AND PRODUCERS TALK ABOUT THE EXPLOSIVE TWO-HOUR SEASON FINALE OF "CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION," AND ABOUT WORKING WITH DIRECTOR QUENTIN TARANTINO

Tarantino Discusses Directing the Finale

"Grave Danger," the two hour season finale of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, will be broadcast Thursday, May 19 (8:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. In the episode, the CSIs are in a desperate race against time to save a member of their team who has been kidnapped and buried alive.

Without revealing too much about the storyline in order to keep it a surprise for viewers, the series' cast members and producers, as well as Quentin Tarantino, who directed and developed the story for the season finale, have this to say about this not-to-be-missed season finale:

[...]

"...I was really surprised at how emotional it [the episode] was. I mean, you read it, and it's intense, and it's action oriented and it's exciting... There were a couple of times I just had to sort of like not cry, and I didn't ever imagine that I would get like that..." - Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) on the season finale script.
