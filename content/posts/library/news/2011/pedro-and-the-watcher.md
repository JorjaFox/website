**Jorja Fox's** on-again. off-again relationship with **"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"** flipped to on-again, as CBS announced she will return to the series as a regular this fall.

After seven seasons as a regular -- and several contract disputes -- Jorja left "CSI", but she and her character, Sara Sidle, soon returned to the show as a recurring guest star for the next four seasons.

It's the second major cast change for "CSI," which announced last week that Ted Danson would join the cast, replacing **Laurence Fishburne.**

The audience for "CSI" has shrunk considerably the past two seasons, as the show has sunk from a regular Top 5 performer to No. 12 in the annual ratings list -- still good, but clearly trending in the wrong direction.

More important than the cast changes may be the new night and time: After a decade at 9 p.m. Thursday, "CSI" will shift to 10 p.m. Wednesday when its new season begins Sept. 21.
