**JH: Original cast member Jorja Fox is coming back for a handful of episodes. Is she coming back in the same role with the CSI group or...?**

NS: In a sense, she is stepping into her old role but it's a little bit of a different Sara. The Sara who left was burnt out, was pretty messed up by the job and what happened to her but when she first came back there was a big question mark in her life which was the nature of her relationship with Grissom but that actually got resolved in a very happy way. What's really fun about having Jorja back is she lightens things up. Sara comes in at a moment in our premiere when the team is a little bit fractured and things aren't quite working very well. She's able to help the guys and Catherine in particular adjust to the new reality of the way things are now. It's a nice way to bring Jorja back into the fold and we're actually having a really good time with it.

**JH: Do we get an update on the Sara/Grissom relationship?**

NS: Yep, there are little bits and pieces there and little mentions that I think the audience will enjoy but you definitely get a little sense of what is going on with them.
