<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00087.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6356" alt="Exile Cap" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00087-250x250.jpg" width="275" height="140" /></a>This was a really good episode. I thought Antonio did it based on the previews, and I'm still convinced he was more involved than he claimed. For Sara, though, it's only two stars. She was in two scenes  and this would have been one star had she not blown up at the club owner, Estefan. Kind of makes you look back on her increasingly angry-Sara attitude lately, knowing what's coming next week, doesn't it?

</ul>
I would say to watch this episode, regardless of the Sara Score, though. It's a _very_ apropos Valentines from CSI.

Next week... Well, let's hold on there. But I'll say this. Prison Jumpsuit.
