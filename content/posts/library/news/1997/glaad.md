On "Whose Appy Now?," the February 6 episode of NBC-TV's hit show E.R., the newly arrived Dr. Maggie Doyle (Jorjan Fox) came out to her sometimes nemesis and co-worker Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle). Over this past season, the two characters have slowly made the transition from fighting over turf and authority to becoming friends. Near the end of the episode, Carter asks Maggie if she wants to go out that evening, but she declines, saying she already has plans. Offering to take him along, they go to a shooting range, where Maggie shows Carter how to aim and fire. At the range, Maggie spies her ex-girlfriend, with whom she just broke up a few months earlier. The ex is a cop, and, as Maggie says, "She's jealous as hell." Carter, startled, shoots out a light at the range.

GLAAD Entertainment Media Director Chastity Bono said, "This new side of Dr. Maggie Doyle will hopefully develop into a strong plot line. GLAAD is eager to see where E.R. takes such a potentially exciting lesbian or bisexual supporting character on this critically acclaimed program."
