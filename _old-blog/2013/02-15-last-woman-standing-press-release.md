<a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/01/david-cassidy-visits-csi/">CSI Files</a> broke the news that David Cassidy (aka Keith Partridge for those of us of a certain age) will be on CSI in episode 16. Jorja will also be in that episode (yay) and David's ex-wife is Kay Lenz, who will play Laura Sidle in episode 15. For those who aren't into retro-70s stuff, David was a teen heartthrob back in the day. Hence I must embarrass him with pictures of his feather'd hair.

So now you can all since the Partridge Family songs to entertain yourselves and wonder if we'll get any scenes with him and Jorja. I hope so.
