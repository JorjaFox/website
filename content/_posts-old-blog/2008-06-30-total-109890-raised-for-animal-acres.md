The drive is over, and any money that trickles in today will be refunded. We've popped the top on our goal with <strong>$1098.90</strong> raised.

Add that to the $1033.28 raised for Burma and that means Jorja Fox Fans raised <b>$2132.18</b> in three months!

From the 80ish year old woman who called me for help setting up her paypal account down to the teenager whose parents called to make sure I was legit before putting their child's allowance in some stranger's paypal account, I salute you all.
