"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" is one of the longest-running police procedural series. The CBS show began in 2000, aired for 15 seasons, and produced several spin-offs. The story follows a team of forensics investigators who solve murders by figuring out what happened at a given crime scene. While the show often explores dark subjects, the team's personal lives are also on display. Notably, fans rooted for the complicated relationship between Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen), whose budding romance is followed across the show's entire run. Dubbed "GSR," the couple's love story quickly became a highlight for viewers.

Naturally, when it was announced that GSR would be returning for "CSI: Vegas," fans rejoiced. The last time the couple had appeared was the 2015 finale, where they reconciled their failed marriage. This long-awaited sequel offered fans an update on their favorite "CSI" couple, and promotional photos implied that they'd be getting plenty of sweet moments to fawn over. However, fan speculation revealed that one Sara and Grissom moment appeared to be missing from Season 1, Episode 3, andÂ Jorja Fox took to Twitter to explain what had happened.

**Jorja Fox admits it was out of her hands**

After "Under the Skin" left "CSI: Vegas" fans confused, Jorja Fox addressed their concerns. "FYI, William (Peterson) & I did shoot a hand holding & kissing scene, I even shot a scene where I talked about where Sara & Grissom have been for the last 5 years," she tweeted. "For some reason the producers and/or network took these scenes out of the show. I have no idea why. You'd have to ask them."

Fox capped off her post with a sad emoji, and fans quickly jumped in to reassure her that it wasn't her fault. Many also thanked her for being transparent about what had happened. "Jorja thank you for telling us. We fans love the characters and their romance. Yes it was disappointing to be teased with it&have it taken away. But we support you and the show regardless. I'm sorry that it seems you're feeling let down also. (Your) adoring fans send you love," replied `@RocknRollLottie`. This sentiment was echoed by others, with `@TVulture15` pointing out that this unexpected edit "must be frustrating for the actors too." Though fans were upset by the exclusion of Sara and Grissom's romantic moments, they were supportive of the actors."We're still gonna love every extra minute we get to spend with Sara. Thank you for giving her back to us," wrote `@sara_bell_um` with a heart emoji.
