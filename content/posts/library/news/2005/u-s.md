On Nov. 19, Animal Acres, LA's newly opened farm animal sanctuary, will celebrate Thanksgiving with a unique celebration called the "Feed A Turkey Ceremony" at the sanctuary in Acton, Calif.

At noon, special guests actresses Daryl Hannah and Jorja Fox (from the No. 1 hit television show CSI) will be helping feed the turkeys and speaking about the need to protect ALL animals from cruelty and neglect. Daryl and Jorja, who are vegetarians, are LA's leading celebrity advocates for animals, and their support of Animal Acres is opening hearts and minds to the plight of turkeys and other farm animals.

From noon to 4 p.m., guests will be able to enjoy tours of the sanctuary featuring three newly rescued baby pigs alongside the children's' favorite baby pig, Bagel. At 1:30 p.m. guests will gather to actually hand feed the turkeys. This will be followed by a delicious vegetarian thanksgiving meal created by LA restaurant Native Foods, one of LA's favorite vegetarian restaurants, served in the sanctuaries gorgeous courtyard.

In addition to nine rescued turkeys, the Animal Acres sanctuary is also home to 25 chickens that were victims of Hurricane Katrina and traveled from Louisiana to find safe haven. Other adorable residents include two calves rescued from a Southern California stockyard, and over 50 sheep recently seized from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse by humane officers.

The Animal Acres "Feed A Turkey" celebration hopes to teach people that farm animals are living sentient animals who deserve protection, and kindness, too. Most states specifically exclude farm animals from anti-cruelty laws. There are no federal laws to protect farm animals from abuse. As a result, farm animals in the United States are raised, transported and slaughtered in conditions considered so cruel they have been banned in other countries.

The sanctuary is directed by Lorri Bauston who co-founded the nation's first shelter for farm animals in 1986. Considered to be the pioneer of the farm animal sanctuary movement, Bauston has helped establish dozens of sanctuaries around the country and her efforts have been featured in several documentaries.
