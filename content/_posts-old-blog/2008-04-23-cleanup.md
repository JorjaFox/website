We're in the process of moving from a thousand categories to ... a thousand tags.  The goal is to both provide an easy way for you (the reader) to look through old post in a well-organized, human-readable manner, as well as optimize searchability and things like Google ranking. We dropped to 6th last night, it was time for action.

Categories will be for high-level organization.  For example, there's a category called Acting, but a post in that category may include the tags 'CSI' and 'Television' and so on.  This is still being refined, naturally.
