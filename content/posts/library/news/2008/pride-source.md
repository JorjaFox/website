I didn't get to tell you, but I recently went with Jenifer Lewis to LA's Gay and Lesbian Center to see "Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield," which was co-produced by Jorja Fox. Due to the limitations of this presentation, certain aspects of the show couldn't be fleshed out, making it somewhat unclear whether this was an actual play or a very good lounge act. What is undeniable is that Kristen Holly Smith is a goldmine of talent and knowledge (she co-wrote the piece). She does an amazing job recreating every era of Springfield's life - in appearance, body language and, most impressively, vocal style. Obviously this is a labor of love for everyone involved, and Jorja tells me this is only the beginning. You can follow the progress of the show at www.StayForeverDusty.com.

BTW, Jorja also revealed that she won't be returning to "CSI" - at least not this season.
