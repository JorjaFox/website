## Synopsis

Grissom and Catherine piece together clues while assembling parts of a skeleton that was apparently cut up with a saw and then scattered on a mountain; Warrick and Sara investigate the death of a male stripper who died shortly after performing at a bachelorette party.

## Review

Sara and Warrick get the case of a dead man in a hotel room -- the one with the 'weird pool', as Sara puts it. The room has been the scene of a party, as well as a possible struggle, as Sara notes from the broken lamp on the floor before she dusts for prints. They track down Lynn Henry, who rented the room for a bachelorette party, but the women claim the victim (a male dancer) was alive when they left at 3 am. Sara notices bruises on Lynn's wrists.

After determining the victim died long before the women said he did, Sara and Warrick bring them in for questioning; the victim had sex before he died, and Sara asks about the bruises on Lynn's wrists again. Lynn claims she was raped and hit the man over the head with the lamp, so while the other two women are released, Lynn is taken to the hospital for a SART (Sexual Assault / Rape Trauma) exam.

Becuase there was no trace of the lamp debris on the victim, Sara and Warrick return to the hotel room. Warrick finds a tiny diamond (actually, cubic zirconia) on the bed. When the SART exam reveals that Lynn hadn't had sex for a while, the women are brought back in during the wedding itself. Detective Riley leaves the room in embarrassment when Sara explains the vaginal clock to the women, to Sara's amusement.

Meg (the bride-to-be) confesses to having consensual sex with the victim and then changing her mind partway through it, hitting him with the lamp. However Meg's ring is a real diamond, and her fiancee's is zirconia. Indeed, his ring is missing a stone, and the fiancee admits to having killed the victim after discovering him having sex with Meg.

## Notes
