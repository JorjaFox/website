**A "CSI" Contract Drama**

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but next time "CSI's" Jorja Fox goes in for a costume fitting, she might find a body bag hanging in her closet. Although a rep for the actress declined to comment, a source close to the show confirms that her contract expires next month and she's itching to pursue greener (and less grisly) pastures. "Her leaving makes perfect sense," says my spy. "She's been there for seven years, she's made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing." And resolve it in what could be a "very" permanent way. Consider the evidence supporting a case of premeditated murder: In "CSI's" May 17th season finale, Grissom and Sara's relationship will be "suddenly forced out into the open," according to CBS. In that same episode, the miniature serial killer returns and Sara goes missing. C'mon, folks &#8212; you don't need a magnifying glass or lab techs to solve this mystery.
