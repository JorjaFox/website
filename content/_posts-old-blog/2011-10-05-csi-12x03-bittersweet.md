<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3855" title="Bittersweet" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/10/bittersweet-230x153.png" alt="Bittersweet" width="230" height="153" />Season 12, episode 3!  Technically Sara's on the B-Plot but she's heavily pimped. Early reports (from our man Shane S. Saunders) say that the episode is heavy on the Sara, light on Catherine and Brass has the week off.
<h3>Official Release</h3>
A sexual sadist walks free after getting a slap on the wrist by the system, and Sara makes it her personal crusade to put the woman back behind bars.

This one gets five stars for Sara.  A downer of an episode though, but amazing.
