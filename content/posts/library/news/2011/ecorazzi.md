**Jorja Fox** spends her days investigating crimes on the TV show 'CSI.' Now, she's asking the public to do some investigating of their own. Not hair remnants or clothing fibers, but the way 10 billion farm animals are raised for food annually in the USA. She wants you to explore vegetarianism.

The actress debuted her new PETA ad at the vegan restaurant Sublime, and even helped with the cooking. They prepared spicy Singapore street noodles, "chicken picatta, and gourmet pizzas.

Fox went vegetarian years ago right in the middle of eating a meat sandwich. She said, "I was having a meatball sub one day in Brooklyn, and it just clicked. I was in the middle of that sandwich, and I put it down, and I never had meat again.

Have you considered putting down the meatball sub and going veg?
