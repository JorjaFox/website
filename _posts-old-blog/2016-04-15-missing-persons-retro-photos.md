I've actually seen the whole show. I picked up the Box Set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Time-Crime-Stephen-Collection/dp/B003QTDH4S">Prime Time Crime:Â The Stephen J. Cannell Collection</a>, which is currently $12 for the DVDs. If you're interested in Jorja when she was super young, pick them up. It's one season and there are a lot of other interesting shows on that.
