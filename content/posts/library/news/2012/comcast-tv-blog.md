**What should fans look forward to next season? And if you haven"t gotten that far yet...what would your dream season be?**

We start with our 'Cape Fear'-style premiere, putting Russell and the team on the line. A villain from the past, former Under Sheriff Jeff McKeen (Conor O"Farrell), who took the life of CSI Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), is now out to get all of our CSIs.

**Do you have a favorite episode, line, or scene from this season? If so, what?**

Sara going mano a mano with a serial killer and bonding with Russell over painful chapters in their past.

And maybe our favorite, seeing the team literally be a team... on the field in a softball game... where Henry (Jon Wellner) drives in the winning run.
