Jorja will be on <a href="http://tradiov.com/la/">TradioV LA</a> (caution: autoplay!) on Thursday to talk about the movie she helped produce, "Extinction Soup." She'll be on at 11am Pacific, so adjust your clocks accordingly. They do record those, so it'll be embeddable afterwards.

The LA Premiere of the movie is this weekend, and it's free.
