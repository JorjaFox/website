<em>CSI</em> will air its Season 15 finale Sunday, February 15, provided there are no more football delays (which, if there are, will be Dec 21 and 28).

Now I will note my surprise seeing <em>Cyber</em> is on Wednesday. Wasn't it supposed to take over <em>CSI</em>'s Sunday slot? Looks like they gave that to <em>Battle Creek</em> and are having <em>Cyber</em> and <em>Stalker</em> switch out.
<blockquote>“Battle Creek,” From Emmy Award-Winning Executive Producers David Shore and
Vince Gilligan, Debuts Sunday, March 1 at 10:00 PM

"CSI: Cyber," Starring Emmy Award Winner Patricia Arquette, Premieres Wednesday, March 4 at 10:00 PM

[...]

CBS Sunday, Effective March 1

7:00-8:00 PM 60 MINUTES
8:00-9:00 PM MADAM SECRETARY
9:00-10:00 PM THE GOOD WIFE
10:00-11:00 PM BATTLE CREEK (P)

CBS Wednesday, Effective March 4

8:00-9:00 PM SURVIVOR
9:00-10:00 PM CRIMINAL MINDS
10:00-11:00 PM CSI: CYBER (P)</blockquote>

What does any of this have with regards to another season of <em>CSI</em>? No idea. CBS swears the short order has no bearing on another season, nor does George's leaving, but we'll just have to wait and see.
