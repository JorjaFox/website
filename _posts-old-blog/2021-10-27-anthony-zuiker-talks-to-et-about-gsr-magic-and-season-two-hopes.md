_CSI_ and _CSI: Vegas_ executive producer Anthony Zuiker spoke to Phillipa Ng about reuniting with Billy and Jorja, what's new and what's old, and what his hopes are for season two.

The big takeaway in the article is the reality that we **do not** yet have a season two pickup. While signs are decent, that really means very little in 2021.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Look, there's no guarantee we'll get picked up. There's no guarantee we'll have Billy and Jorja back. What I will say is, every episode that they star in is special and to take full advantage of them on screen. It's a luxury to have them back.<cite>Source: <a href="https://www.etonline.com/csi-creator-on-the-magic-of-reuniting-with-william-petersen-and-jorja-fox-on-vegas-revival">'CSI' Creator on the Magic of Reuniting With William Petersen and Jorja Fox on 'Vegas' Revival (Exclusive)</a></cite></blockquote>

So fingers crossed here!
