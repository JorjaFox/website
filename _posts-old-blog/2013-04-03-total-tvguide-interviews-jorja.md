Though <em>why</em> did they have to pic that picture which was way too photoshopped.

Ah well you can't have it all.
<blockquote>**Your big break came in <em>ER</em> in the mid-Nineties. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?
**For me, it was the first time that people were really going to see my work. So I was scared senseless. On the night I got the job, I honestly almost drove to Mexico, because I was so terrified. I nearly told them I didn't want to do it. But it was very thrilling for me to work with people who were so talented. And a great honour.</blockquote>

They actually have two slightly different interviews, and the print one had this about GSR:
<blockquote>**This week, the CSI team is spooked by a case that brings back memories of their murdered colleague, Warrick Brown. How does that store compare to the rest of this series?**

This season is unique, because almost every episode impacts on one of the characters in a personal level. In an episode we shot recently, Sara's ex-boyfriend comes to town, and she has to grapple with that. For her, there's always a steady theme of love ... or not! She's married to someone she's deeply in love with, but she doesn't see him very much.

**Of course, her husband is former colleague Gil Grissom. Were you showed when they ended up together?**

Well, the bigger surprise for me was that I returned to the show! I came back in the eighth season, when Gil was leaving, to tell that storyline. I never imagined that I would be invited to return to the show, and of course, when I was asked, I couldn't say no, because it's been such an amazing ride. I knew that Gil and Sara were going to take off, but I didn't know that Sara was ever going to come back.</blockquote>
