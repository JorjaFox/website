On the 10th of April, Ted Danson was tweeting via the CBS Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/CSI_CBS">@CSI_CBS</a>

When asked about guest stars, he replied he wanted to see Billy!

When asked about working with Jorja, he said it was a dream to work with her.

(For you kids, 555-1212 is the old number you called in the US to get information. These days it's 411, or y'know, the Internet.)
