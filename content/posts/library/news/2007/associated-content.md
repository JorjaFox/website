Rumors are swirling that CSI is set to kill off Sara Sidle. "TV Guide" is reporting that the Jorja Fox's contract is up next month and that she may not renew.

"TV Guide" quotes a source close to the show, "Her leaving makes perfect sense. She's been there for seven years, she's made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing."

On the other hand Fox seems perfectly content and hasn't made any public rumblings about leaving.

In a recent interview Fox responded to queries about the cast in general. "Yeah, as far as I know, everybody will be back."

Still Fox's people and CBS are being extremely tight lipped.

This begs the question. Why so much ambiguity surrounding Fox's return? All indications point to a cliff hanger involving Fox.

In fact the Chicago Tribune reports that Sara will go missing in the season finale. This will force the super secret Grissom Sara relationship into the open. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that releasing Fox's contract negotiations would spoil the impact of the episode.

While some message boards seems pleased by the idea of no Sara in Season 8 other fans are panicked by the idea that Fox might be done with the show. Still others are optimistic about any storyline that brings Sara Grissom out in the open.

"I'll admit I'm slightly concerned," said Grissom Sara shipper MsGrits. "However, based on Jorja's attitude and the appeal of the Grissom and Sara relationship I'm hopeful that the season finale will have a positive impact on the ship in general.

I believe that Grissom and Sara have contributed heavily to CSI's strength and viability in their sevent season. I don't think it would be pragmatic to just end that relationship now."

This season has seen Grissom both giddy about his lady love and completely freaked out the by uber creepy Miniature Killer. The psycho sociopath has sent Grissom life sized replicas of past, present and future crime scenes. One man confessed and and killed himself to boot. Of course nothing is resolved that easily in TV serial killer land or in contract negotiations.

Stay tunned.
