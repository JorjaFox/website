Jorja Fox: Can you hear that? The Earth. Home to millions of species. Take a moment. Listen. In the rainforests of Borneo, orphan orangutans are being given a second chance, but they need out help. Or we'll be left here all alone. Save the forest, save the planet, reach out and save the orangutans. To find out how you can help, please visit us online at redapes.org.
