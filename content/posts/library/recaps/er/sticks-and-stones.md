## Summary

During a paramedic ride-along, Carter is forced to drive the ambulance while fleeing a riot scene and inadvertently runs over a teenage boy. Later, a paramedic is shot by an angry mob looking for the driver of the ambulance. Carol is despondent following Doug's departure. She later discloses that she's pregnant. Kerry is intrigued by an injured pro wrestler and his relationship with his father. Lucy tangles with an Asian family that requests their matriarch not be told of a cancerous tumor. Jeanie turns down dates with both Dr. Baker and Reggie, telling each she's seeing someone else.

## Review

In the beginning of the episode, Carter shares stories with Maggie and Jerry about his night shift ride-along with the paramedics. Later on, Maggie supervises Lucy with an elderly Chinese woman who has lung cancer that has spread to her brain and is causing seizures. Lucy offers to speak to the family instead of having Maggie do it, and is stunned to find out the family knew, and wasn't telling the older lady because it would just depress her. Lucy tells her anyway, which proceeds another seziure. Maggie helps Lucy control the seizure, and when the woman comes to, she can't remember a thing about the day, though the family want a new doctor. In the end, Lucy tells the woman that she has epilepsy.

Throughout the entire ordeal, Maggie supports Lucy, as a good teacher should.
