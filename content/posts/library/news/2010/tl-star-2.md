*This article has been translated from it's original French.*

 *Jorja Fox, 42, will return for the eleventh season as Sara Sidle. While CSI is ailing the United States, the actress puts things in the clear. Exclusively.*

**Tele Star: After a thriller about your presence, then you will play in the season 11 Experts ... **

**Jorja Fox:** Yes, I'm returning for eleven episodes. I'll decide January if I want to continue. Turn a few episodes for me. That leaves me free time for other activities.

**Why has it taken so long? **

**J.F.:** To be honest, I hesitated to re-sign. Between ER and CSI, I've been on TV series for twelve years. I started to feel my energy wane and I fear that this is way to the screen.

**What made you finally decide? **

**J.F.:** When I decided to continue, it was because I felt the whole team, from actors to writers, were in tune.

**Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows in the series) has it, decided to leave. You understand her choice? **

**J.F.:** But nothing says she won't change her mind. (She smiles.) I know her well and I think she may reverse her decision.

**Is it true that George Eads (aka Nick) has also been close to leaving ...**

**J.F.:** It was close, yes. He signed his contract only two days before the beginning of shooting. We felt a certain tension on the set.

**These hesitations and these departures, are they linked with the salary increase of employees involved? **

**J.F.:** I don't think so. Moreover, it is not just actors, but also the writers and technicians. All Americans are concerned by the crisis. So we understand that we should also tighten our belts.

**People say the show is out of steam in the U.S., actors are leaving ... How do you revive the series? **

**JF:** I do not think we need to make too many changes. And in the long run, the CSI series are the most watched in the world.

**However, the writers have announced changes ... **

**J.F.:** True. This will be an important year for the character of Marg! And there are great chances that we might see Grissom.

**Female solidarity ineffective**

After William Petersen (Grissom) and Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), it is time for the character of Wendy Simms (one of the heroines often confined to the laboratory) to disappear from the series. Liz Vassey has indeed been thanked by the production. It's a great dissapointment to Jorja Fox: "I am very disappointed. Liz, Marg and I were the only heroines. We wanted to look for more women, it's sad."
