Jorja Fox was supposed to die at the end of "CSI" this year - but she has refused to show up for work on the set to film her "death scene."

According to reports, the show's execs have been unhappy with the star's salary demands, and decided to kill off her CSI character, Sara Sidle, who's in a secret romance with boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen).

Fox was scheduled to film Sara's death scene late last month, when her character was supposed to be crushed by a car for the May 17 season finale. But Fox wouldn't show up for work, forcing the producers to film an alternate ending - including last-minute script rewrites and flying co-star Marg Helgenberger from L.A. to Vegas for expensive re-shoots.

Fox's rep told The New York Post yesterday that the actress' future on the show was up in the air. "Her contract is up and they are in conversations," said the spokeswoman.

This was not Fox's first salary dispute with the show. In 2004, she and co-star George Eads, who plays Nick Stokes, were fired by CBS after refusing to come to work during a contract dispute. They were re-hired a few days later.

Fox reportedly rakes in $100,000-per-episode and was demanding a "major raise." CBS reportedly offered her a "moderate raise," which she balked at.

The story could be bogus but something is going on. The Chicago Tribune reports that Sara will "go missing" in the season finale cliffhanger.
