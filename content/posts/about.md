**Fans of Lefox** (formerly "A Jorja Fox Fansite", formerly "Jorja Fox: Online") has been serving the internet since 1996 with the goal of being a one stop-shop for information about the actress, musician, playwright and producer, Jorja Fox. Jorja Fox is an actress, producer, humanitarian, activist and environmentalist. She has been seen on such hit TV shows as _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_, _ER_, _The West Wing_ and _Law &amp; Order_, as well as indie movies like Memento and Food for the Heart.

We are _not_ an official Jorja Fox website and are run by fans for no monetary compensation. Her official site is at [jorjafox.com](https://www.jorjafox.com/)

This website is run by Mika Epstein, who's been maintaining the site since December 1996. It is run entirely by fans for no monetary compensation. No one gets paid or makes a profit off this site.
