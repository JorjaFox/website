Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on CSI, has decided to leave the CBS crime show, USA Today reported today.

"There are all theses things I want to do. Some are personal and some are professional and I really need to do some of them before I get too old," Fox told EW.com.

Fox, 39, will appear in five more episodes before heading off on her own.

Fox left Melbourne Beach midway through her senior year in December 1985.

Her resume was modest. She had taken modeling classes as a kid, done a little drama work in high school, and she'd had a couple of brief glimpses of gore as an emergency-room volunteer.

Fox attended Gemini Elementary, Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy, Hoover Junior High and Melbourne High during her 13 years here. She was also a candy striper at Holmes Regional Medical Center, and her brother Jeff, 12 years her senior, was once a member of the Melbourne Beach Volunteer Fire Department.
