<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Recap</strong></span>

CSI Files got an advanced viewing of the episode, and it's looking good for Sara. <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2012/09/advance-review-csi-crime-scene-investigation-karma-to-burn/">Read the review on CSI Files, if you're spoiler-okay</a>.

Recap and screencaps will be up late Wednesday/early Thursday. My hours are a little weird (and soon I'll be in Pacific time, which means recaps will be much later).
