You'll have to watch the video for it, and I already asked.   Jorja's at the 30 second mark, right after Daisy Fuentes.  The photo's <strong>not</strong> publicly available, so don't pester him about that, and also please don't scrape the photo and post it, out of respect to the photographer's wishes.  Remember, we're good people.  Do the right thing.
