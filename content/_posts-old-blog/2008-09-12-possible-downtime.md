JFO needs an upgrade.  We're running low on diskspace, we're pegging the processor (even after trimming things down) and the option is to raise our monthly cost by $5 or $50.  We can't afford the $50 extra a month, so we're gonna try the $5 route, which will double diskspace and bandwidth (no downtime in October like last year!).

If you can't ping JFO this weekend, that's why.  Sorry for the short notice.

<b>Edit</b> Server is upgraded. DNS caching is ongoing.
