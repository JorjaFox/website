At long last, <a href="http://jorjafox.com">JorjaFox.com</a>Â is back! You'll notice JorjaFox.org redirects there.

<a href="http://www.jorjafox.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10132" alt="Jorja's headshot at JFCOM" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/03/jorjafoxcom.jpg" width="600" height="439" /></a>

The site is direct, basic, and to the point. It's that brown earth tone she had on her first website, and it links to Facebook and Twitter.

Am I sure this is Jorja? Well I work for a webhost, so I checked the history of the domain and noted that it's been owned by the same account since it's inception. Now since we know both jorjafox.com and jorjafox.org were (once) owned by Jorja, and I know that they're still owned by the same account, it's simple induction logic here. It's her.

Now to get her account verified by Twitter. You'll notice we all tweeted at @verified. That's because Twitter is a little odd, and doesn't think someone saying "It's me!" is proof enough of a reason to verify. Not everyone gets verified, you see, because they don't think everyone needs it. And one of their criteria is to 'prove' it on your website. Apparently Team Jorja took that as "challenge accepted."

I kind of feel bad, but Twitter's about to meet the Jorja Nation...
