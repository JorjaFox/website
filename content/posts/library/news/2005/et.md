Mark also catches up with JORJA FOX, who reveals, "This is my favorite set on the show. It is a graphic, gruesome place."

Jorja also fills Mark in that no animals or insects have ever been hurt on the show. They are under the protection of a Humane Society representative who makes sure they are well taken care of and that they recently switched the company that supplies their gloves.

"Rubber smells horrible and it lasts for days," she explains. "Even after you wash your hands, you can still smell it. We have recently moved to a new glove product that doesn't have latex in it and is supposed to be better for the environment. We have been trying to do that for awhile and the thing that everybody is so excited about is it doesn't smell. Everybody feels cooler about that."

On tonight's episode, Catherine (Marg) and Warrick (Gary) discover two bodies in tar that turn out to be Russian mail-order brides, who came to the U.S. in hopes of getting married and getting citizenship; while Sara (Jorja) winds up in trouble.

"Sara has a bit of a meltdown," Jorja tells Mark. "It is not the first time in the five years that the character is in professional and personal trouble. Sara is very passionate and has a bit of a temper and you are going to see all that tonight and more.

"Everybody has a past and a history. Sara's is a little more muddled and complicated than some and we are going to open the door on that tonight."
