## Synopsis

A normal night in Las Vegas turns into a killing spree, when a young boy is the critical witness to a shoot out that least two men dead on the tram. Nick tries to bond with the boy, but it's the new supervisor, D.B. Russell, who connects with an invisible tennis ball. The autopsy shows that one of the dead men from the shoot out was actually stabbed to death, and the evidence shows that an octopus was on the tram. In the end, the death was caused by a man dying of cancer trying to protect his brother, and a bystander misinterpreting the situation.

Out in Brim County, Sara and Greg look into an old body with a new head, stabbed to death in a trailer park. The body's skin is disconnected from the muscle tissue, which was done by an air compresser, which Greg's cousin does to make skinning dear easier. The owner of the nearest air compresser explains that they'd bagged a dear, but it came back to life and gored Dell. Dell decided to clean the wound with the air compresser, which got stuck in him and on, killing him.

Doc Robbins and Jim Brass talk about Ray Langston, briefly, and how he's been railroaded out of CSI by IA, but it's saved his life. He's doing fine. However the fallout resulted in Catherine being demoted, and all the CSIs having to follow the book, which doesn't sit well with everyone.
