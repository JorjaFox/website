Fresh from Shane Saunders ala CSI Files, Sara just can't catch a break when <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/01/carter-macintyre-visits-csi/">Carter MacIntyre visits CSI</a>
<blockquote><em>Drop Dead Diva</em>‘s <strong>Carter MacIntyre</strong>, most recently seen on <em>Private Practice</em>, will appear in <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>‘s fifteenth episode, I have learned exclusively. In the “Forget Me Not” installment, scheduled to air February 20, MacIntyre will play Taylor Wynard, a man Sara comes across at dinner during her stay at a Las Vegas hotel. When Wynard ends up dead, Sara informs DB Russell (<strong>Ted Danson</strong>) that she knows the victim and that she was in his hotel room the night before. Though she denies being romantically involved with Wynard, all evidence suggests otherwise and her lying in the matter doesn’t help her case.</blockquote>

What do you think? Would Sara Sidle, who was the other woman with Hank, ever cheat on Grissom? Or is this all part of the ploy to frame Sara for murder? And why <em>was</em> Sara in that hotel in the first place? A missed rendezvous with Grissom? How shades of "The Two Mrs. Grissoms"...
