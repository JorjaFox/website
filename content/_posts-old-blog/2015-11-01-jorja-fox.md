Out of England, there have been strange rumblings of someone named Jorja Fox being in a couple horror movies.

But... notÂ <em>our</em> Jorja!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JorjaMRFox/posts/10152580346015345"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13794" src="//jfo-static.net/wordpress/2015/11/jmrfox.png" alt="Screenshot of Jorja MR Fox's facebook page" width="1062" height="559" /></a>

This other Jorja (Jorja Mimi Rose Fox apparently) is a British actress. She's into horror a little, zombies and such. She has her own <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6444218/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2">IMDb page</a>, and yes, I've submitted corrections.
