This is the new favorite show around the Nerdslut Electronic Hearth. Focusing on a group of Forensic Scientists and Technicians in Las Vegas, Nevada, you get to watch two or three different crimes get solved every episode. The science is primary &#8212; and that's what makes it so great. While occasional diversions are inserted into the scripts (e.g., Marge Heckelberger's ex-husband, a gambling problem gone awry,) for the most part it's good solid geek fun, and some mystery to boot. While most people know that the crime scene teams never question suspects the way they do here, somehow it seems forgiveable when you get stories like ear printing, forensic entymology and how you catch someone who has set up their own kidnapping. As an added bonus, it seems that Jorja Fox has finally found a home for a while. (You may remember her from ER, as queer Dr. Maggie Doyle, or as the President's daughter's bodyguard on The West Wing, or even for her cameo on Ellen's coming out episode.) We love Jorja, and here's hoping CSI has a long and interesting life.
