## Synopsis

The CSI team investigates a murder with ties to two teenaged kidnapped girls.

Cara and Lexi Nolan are in Vegas with their dad's credit card. When Pete Corday (aged 23), a young man who went off with the younger sister, Cara (aged 13), turns up dead, the hunt is on for the girls, who happen to the the daughters of John Nolan, director for the crime lab in San Diego. Lexi (aged 17) had ditched her sister to hook up with a sex trafficker named Axel Vargas (aged 25).

Lexi is found dead in a dumpster, still in Vegas, killed from a rare scorpion sting which, when combined with the video she took on her phone, is tracked back to Kieran Clark. Clark had been stalking a woman who looked incredibly like Cara. Clark kidnapped her because she looked just like the woman he obsessed over.

## Review

Sara doesn't appreciate people who abuse women in any way. She's aggressive towards Axel but kinder to Tori when explaining the graphic photos found on Lexi's phone.

## Notes

* Parents fighting make Sara uncomfortable
