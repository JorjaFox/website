Blood is on the floor at "CSI": CBS has fired thesps George Eads and Jorja Fox from the hit Eye drama for breach of contract.

Eye toppers Leslie Moonves and Nancy Tellem, apparently drawing a line in their sand, made the decision after Eads &#8212; looking for a pay hike &#8212; failed to show up to work Thursday, the first day of production on the new season of the skein. Fox reported to duty, but insiders said her reps had been asking for more coin, and the Eye acted after Fox failed to reply to a letter asking her if she had any plans to not show up to work.

Both actors were in the fifth year of seven-year pacts. A search has already begun for new actors to join the show. It's unclear if their parts will be recast or if creators will come up with new characters.

It's not unusual for producers and nets to fire thesps on procedural dramas as part of salary disputes. Dick Wolf, for example, fired the stars of "New York Undercover" after they went public with their salary beefs.

Moonves also played hardball with the supporting cast of "Becker," refusing to meet their salary demands. Thesps ulimately relented.
