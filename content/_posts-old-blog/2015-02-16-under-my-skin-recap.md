Again, we give it four stars for the amount of Sara. Also angry Sara with regards to sex trafficking.

Nick carried the emotional aspect of the case, leaving Sara to do most of the field work. The best moment though was when the Nolan parents were fighting in front of Sara. Jorja was, again, note perfect when she had that split second of panic. Of course Sara hates when parents fight in front of her.
