<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/05/failwhale.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/05/failwhale-100x100.png" alt="failwhale" title="failwhale" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1866" /></a> I post this about once a week or more on Twitter: I am not Jorja Fox!

It's pretty straightforward, and most of you already know that I'm actually a web guru, software programmer with a penchant towards mysteries. And yet. A lot of people see 'Jorja Fox' and think 'Look! It's a celeb who Twitters!'  Flattering as that is, I'm not a celeb.  I take it all with a great deal of humor.

That sort of Twitter problem is fun to macabre-humor me.  The actual problem I have is following and followers.

I don't count my followers as an achievement any more than I count the visitors or people who subscribe to my RSS feed here.  The goal of JFO has never been numbers but content and community, and frankly, we succeed in those.  I also don't want to use Twitter as advertising.  We have ads on the site, and enough people find interesting things to click on with them that the site is keeping itself even (if we make $.70 a day, we're good, we're averaging a buck).  So what do I want to use Twitter for?

I'm going to have to say communication.

You want Jorja News, I have it, I love to share it, and I want you to have everything that's cool and new about Jorja, the work she does, the stuff she cares about, and basically celebrate her awesomeness.  In order to do that, to make Twitter a useful tool, I have to stop following some of you whom I adore.  And you have no idea how hard that is.

But! I have a solution.  If you want to just get Jorja news, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jorjafoxonline">@jorjafoxonline</a>. If you want to chat with me, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ipstenu">@ipstenu</a> (I know, shocking!).  As @ipstenu, I like to follow and chat with my friends and folks I know from online.  As @jorjafoxonline, I'm going to follow news sites, people who Jorja works with, accounts for things she supports like @redapes and @OfficialPETA and so on.  I'm going to use Twitter for breaking news while I'm working together a longer blog post with details (like how I got out the news of "Drop Dead Diva").

So yes, I've just unfollowed about 300 people as @jorjafoxonline, dropping me down to just under 20.  It's nothing personal. You can still @ reply me, and I'll see it. I'll have a better chance of replying back now, actually, because I'll have less to read.  If you have news I don't, tweet @jorjafoxonline! If you need clarification, tweet @jorjafoxonline! If you think I'm a loser, tweet @ipstenu!

See you on the twit-side.
