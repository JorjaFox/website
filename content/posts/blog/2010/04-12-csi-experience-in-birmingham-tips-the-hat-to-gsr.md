And not just for CSI. No, check it for the additions.

<blockquote>For those in the UK that have not visited the CSI Experience in Birmingham, do, it is wonderful, especially if you go with a CSI friend or two [...] Yup squeeeing in public does get you funny looks .

But the biggest shock was, at the end, there is a replica of Grissoms' office, that is ok per say, not the real thing but a nice touch, like Milton's book of poetry on a stack of books on his desk [...] but the biggest shock was, well I think one of the organisers must be a GSR fan, take a look as to what was on Grissoms' filing cabinet.</blockquote>
