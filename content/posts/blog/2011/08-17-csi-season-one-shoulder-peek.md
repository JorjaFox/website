Jeffrey Hunt (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/Huntvision/">@huntvision</a>) decided to play a game with Shane Saunders (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/shanessaunders/">@shanessaunders</a>) on Twitter, to see how many pics Shane could guess their episodes.

Shane won, and pointed out to me that Jorja's in that pic!
