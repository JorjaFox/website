I have ten VHS tapes of Jorja, no VHS player, and a need to cut down on what I've got.

Basically here's what's going on: <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2012/wp-quit-bank/">I quit my job at the bank and I'm moving out to California in two months for a new one.</a> So yeah, I need to get rid of anything I don't want to haul around. I put a lot up on Craigslist, but my Jorja VHS collection I want to put to you first.

For everyone who donates to JFO before September 15th is automatically entered in a name-draw for the tapes. You don't have to donate a lot. Five bucks or fifty, it's no matter. Money goes back to funding JFO, and to me having less to haul 2000 miles. Before you worry, no, I'm not giving up JFO, I'm just downsizing. You'll notice I'm not giving up my DVDs of Jorja, after all. It's just that I don't have a VHS player anymore! Time for these to go to a good home.

The 'official' tapes are:
<ul>
	<li>The Jerky Boys</li>
	<li>The Kill-Off</li>
	<li>Dead Funny</li>
	<li>Ellen - The Puppy Episode</li>
</ul>
The recordings are:
<ul>
	<li>Forever Fabulous</li>
	<li>Jorja on Craig Kilbourne - June 26th, 2002</li>
	<li>Alchemy</li>
	<li>How To Make The Cruelest Month</li>
	<li>Jorja on The View</li>
	<li>The House of Frankenstein 1999</li>
</ul>
