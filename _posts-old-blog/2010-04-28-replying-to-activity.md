If you've checked out the Sitewide Activity section, you may have noticed that SOME updates you can reply to, and some you can't.

This post is an example of general user generated activity.  In this example, I've posted what I'm up to (or rather what I'm thinking) and made it public activity:
<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/canreply.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/canreply.png" alt="" width="300" height="105" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" /></a>

There's a reply button to these posts because they're self-contained. It's just a comment, people reply, and so on and so forth. It's like commenting on a FaceBook post, or a Tweet.

On the other hand, sitewide activity also includes all blog posts and comments, and those, you _cannot_ reply too within sitewide activity:
<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/cantreply.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/cantreply.png" alt="" width="300" height="110" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36" /></a>
<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/centreply2.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/centreply2.png" alt="" width="300" height="120" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-37" /></a>

Why? Because they're blog posts. If you want to reply to those, you have to click on 'view' and reply within the blog post.  Not a good enough reason? Well, if you replied in the sitewide activity section, it wouldn't update the blog comments.  So unless they change that little feature, this is what we get for now.
