Which you can all tell.  The layout hadn't changed since the Wiki, and that's been since 2006 so it was definitely time for a change.  I admit, it still looks best on Firefox or Safari, but this one actually looks better on IE too!  If you're having trouble with the layout, hold down shift and refresh, or clear your cache.

The header will rotate through various places we're campaigning for, so if you're running a Jorja related charity or fundraising drive, let us know and we'll post it!

As for graphics, yes, it's minimalist.  If someone wants to make a fancier header image, have at. It needs to allow for text to be read.  The part with Jorja's face is 75px tall, and the dark green bars are 35px.
