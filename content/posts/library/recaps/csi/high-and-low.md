## Synopsis

Grissom, Warrick, and Nick investigate the case of man who apparently was murdered and pushed off a six story building. Grissom's involvement is cut short by renewed hearing problems. Catherine looks into the murder of man outside of his regular bar.

## Review

Sara only appears in the scene quoted below, having maxed out on her overtime and is not permitted in the field for a while.

## Notes

* Sara doesn't consider Hank her boyfriend.
* Catherine does not back Sara up when it comes to policy or Grissom (see also "Nesting Dolls").
* Sara once again shows her phobia of germs in public places.

## Quotes

**Sara:** _(cough to get Willows' attention)_ Can you help me out?\
**Catherine:** Ahh ... Depends.\
**Sara:** I can't get out into the field because I'm maxed out on overtime for the month.\
**Catherine:** Ah and you're confined to the lab, huh? Well hey, look, it's regular hours. I mean go have dinner with the boyfriend. _(pause)_ Hank. Right? And, and go to a spa.\
**Sara:** Hank is not my boyfriend. And you know, those places are filled with bacteria.\
**Catherine:** Sara, I don't make the rules around here. You gotta talk to Grissom about that.\
**Sara:** Yeah. Um. He's, um, not really in the talking mood.\
**Catherine:** What makes you think he's gonna talk to me?\
**Sara:** _(shrugs)_\
**Catherine:** Get some rest.\
**Sara:** I'm not tired! Really! I'm not tired.
