HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - It was difficult to conduct interviews with director Allison Anders and stars Kim Dickens and Gabriel Mann Thursday during Showtime's "Things Behind the Sun" premiere after-party at the Paramount Theater.

Tearful guests could not stop coming up to these three, professing love and gratitude; one fan literally bowed to kiss Dickens' foot.

This is the intense reaction a film about a 12-year-old's gang rape will provoke in people. That the story is based on Anders' own experience and was filmed in the house where her rape took place many years ago did not do much to lighten the mood.

"I think I am pretty much done with this," Anders said of her rape. "When I walked into that house, it was over for me, and I was exhilarated."

Dickens portrays the grown-up victim, a singer, trying to come to terms with her traumatic past. She credits her performance to Anders: "I had her as my guide, so I felt really safe," Dickens said. "By the time we started filming, she was relieved, and it was a joyful process."

The low-key party featured music by Anders' daughter, Tiffany, who was also featured on the film's soundtrack.

Guests included thesps Mario Van Peebles, Mike Farrell, Jorja Fox and Ellen DeGeneres.
