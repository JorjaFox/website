Remember to go give <a href="http://shanessaunders.com">ShaneSSaunders.com</a> credit when you repost this, folks!  If you don't, bad karma will happen to you!

Bear in mind none of this is set in stone yet, but here's what it looks like.  Contracts are signed in May-June, with filming starting in July normally.  Right now, <em> everyone </em>'s contract is being negotiated, so we're not going to know for sure for a month!  With that in mind, Shane talked to Christopher Barbour today to clear up rumors and truth.

Today the rumors are:

<em>RUMOR:</em> **Jorja Fox** is expected to return in some capacity.
<em>FACT:</em> This is all my gut feeling.  I suspect it'll be similar to the same part-time/full-time capacity as she had in season 11 (that is, she will be listed as main cast, but not appear in every episode).

<em>RUMOR:</em> **William Petersen** will also come back for some episodes.  Certainly for Marg's last episode(s), but the total number isn't determined yet.
<em>FACT:</em>  Well he won't be back for the season finale, but the rest is up in the air.  Marg's recent interview with **Télé Star** magazine (see: Marg Helgenberger: “Grissom Will Return to CSI”) certainly seems to think so!

<em>RUMOR:</em> **Marg Helgenberger** will be back for at least some episodes in some capacity.
<em>FACT:</em> Yes, she will be back, but we don't know for how many eps or how long.

<em>RUMOR:</em> **Laurence Fishburne** is being written off.
<em>FACT:</em> He may not be there for the whole season.  That is, quite literally, all I know about that matter!

That's what we have right now folks. Take a deep breath!
