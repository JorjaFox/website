A permanent disappearance during a magic trick means it's time to call in the "CSI" crew. Inhuman blood droplets and the discovery of a razor sharp knife just magnify the mystery for investigators. And as star JORJA FOX told ET, tonight's episode on CBS is so realistic that it frightened her. Meanwhile, over at "CSI's" sister show, "CSI: Miami," a decision has been made regarding an episode that features a sniper. CBS has decided to now air the episode on November 18th as originally scheduled. The network had planned to withhold the sniper episode because of the Washington, D.C.-area shootings. The story was developed in August, several weeks before the attacks began.
