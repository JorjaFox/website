"Doing this show was one of the most rewarding things in my life. I've been one of the luckiest people in the history of TV getting to play Sara. My character had a full personal life, with a couple boyfriends, a couple meltdowns. She was almost killed a couple of times. They almost blew me up one! I feel like the writers were extremely generous in terms of giving me a lot to do, especially all the interesting relationship stuff between Sara and Grissom. I couldn't possibly have scored any higher than getting William Petersen to be my boyfriend on TV. Amazing."
