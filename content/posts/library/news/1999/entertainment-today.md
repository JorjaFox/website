Don't let the slightly misogynistic title fool you. This food-themed film, focusing on thirtysomethings at the helm of change, can be compared to *Soul Food* and *Eat Drink Man Woman* with a dash of *Like Water for Chocolate*. Single mother Delmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox) dreams of opening a restaurant called The Hungry Bachelors Club, so named for the weekly bachelor-littered dinner parties she throws. Without enough money, however, Delmar agrees to "loan an egg and rent a womb" to a couple willing to pay $50,000. Meanwhile, her best friend Hortense (Suzanne Mara) is dieting profusely for her lawyer boyfriend - who is supposed to propose - while a writer forcefully pines for her. Delmar's brother Jethro (Peter Murnik) brings drug abuser Missy (Katherine Kendall) and ex-con Moses (Bill Nunn) into the circle of friends and family; they in turn discover new beginnings with the Youngbloods. You can call it a gumbo of stories - from hot topic issues of interracial relationships and surrogate motherhood to the more ubiquitous fear of commitment and second chances. Absolutely nothing is heavy-handed in this film, almost to a fault, but Greg Ruzzin manages to keep this close-knit community feeling real. The actors also pull off quite a feat, collectively keeping the story funny, involving and dramatic, in a quiet and almost private way, like they're hiding a constantly running stream of consciousness behind their seemingly mundane actions.
