Some people were surprised to see her listed.  Does that mean the promo monkey lied and she's not in this episode? I'm not sure, so I'm playing it safe.

Speculate and spoil yourselves away. I'll update the post later tonight, once I have screencaps etc. They should all be up by midnight Eastern time.  If Jorja's not in the episode, I'll let you know ASAFP.
