Another Sorkin mistake was casting Moira Kelly as a political consultant who began the series as Josh's ex-girlfriend but whose scowly, abrasive role has evaporated into a series of background grimaces. "Moira is a terrific actress," says Sorkin diplomatically. "[But] we just weren't the right thing for her. She expressed that she felt the same way, and as a result, story lines haven't been invested in that character, because we knew that at the end of the year, we'd be shaking hands and parting company." Bye-bye, Moira, who did not respond to requests to comment on her departure.

In her place, Marlee Matlin has already filmed two episodes as a tough consultant who'll tangle with Josh, and Sorkin confirms the rumor that next season, a few younger female characters will be added to the show-"because we work really hard and we deserve it," he kids, before admitting it's in response to a network desire to attract a younger demographic. "I will be introducing a cadre of specially trained 15-year-old senior counsels to the President," jokes Sorkin. "It's going to be like The Mod Squad." But no kidding: New staffers will include Jorja Fox (formerly Dr. Maggie Doyle of ER) as a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the President's daughter (played by Elizabeth Moss) as she attends college and fends off white-racist threats for dating Charlie-you know, the black tattooed love-god aide.
