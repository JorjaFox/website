In this episode, there's a lot about Connie.  Like a cancer scare, the revelation her ex-husband was an alcoholic and hit her, and that her father's kind of an idiot.  But for you, I pulled two good scenes for Jorja, where she's discussing the possibility of cancer. Oh, and Johnny saw her 'husband' sucking face with some red-head.  Actually, it was Connie's brother, but ... he didn't know that.

We're not even halfway through the season, so there are more clips and caps to be had.  And don't think that just because we broke $500 this is over.  If you donate, I will clip!
