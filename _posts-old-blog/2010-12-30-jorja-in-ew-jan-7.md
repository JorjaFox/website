Sadly?  It's the same news they posted online!  But she's in the magazine, so yay!

<blockquote>**Status Report: TV's big burning questions**

Now that Jorja Fox is back for at least 11 episodes of "CSI" this season, will William Petersen, who played her onscreen husband, Gil Grissom, appear?  Answer...."Sadly, no. "We're bugged by it," admits exec producer Carol Mendelsohn.  "Gil is the legacy of "CSI". You can never say he's the one who shall not be named. We constantly bug him (about returning)."  Until then, fans will have to settle for meeting Grissom's long-lost mother, played by deaf actress Phyllis Frelich, in the Feb. 3 episode.</blockquote>
