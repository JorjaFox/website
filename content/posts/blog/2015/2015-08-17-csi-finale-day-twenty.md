It's day 14 of filming (remember they don't generally film on weekends right now, no need to) and today is Anthony Zuiker's birthday! Thursday, by the way, is the last day of production. Expect tears.

It's from a few days ago.

Today was Robert David Hall and David Berman's last day. Super Dave, we love you.
