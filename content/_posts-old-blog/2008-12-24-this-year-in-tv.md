<blockquote><strong>Dude, They Killed Warrick:</strong> <strong>"CSI</strong>" killed off <strong>Gary Dourdan</strong>'s character in a season-ending cliffhanger that revealed Warrick died in Grissom's arms. Not coincidentally, Warrick's death occurred shortly after Dourdan was busted in real life for possession of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills. But hey, at least we got Jorja Fox back for a few episodes this season. Next to depart: William Petersen, who will leave the show in the Jan. 15 episode, with a new character, played by <strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong>, joining the cast in the episode previous.</blockquote>
