Mika's still in Japan, however here's a bit of a roundup for you.

&bull; Jorja got the card from Animal Acres and is impressed with us (I'll reprint the email when I can - Sunday maybe)
&bull; Jorja Fox speaks to the press on behalf of Animal Defenders Intl.
&bull; <a href=http://www.ntxe-news.com/artman/publish/article_47389.shtml>More ADI news</a>
&bull; <a href=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/07/william-peterse.html>Ausiello says WP is leaving CSI</a> (and there's Sara info in the article)

There are at least 10 more articles to go through, but honestly I'm so zoned right now I need the sleep.  I'll try and update more tomorrow.
