Table Reads started last Monday.  Friday was the first day of filming.  Now the crew is off to Las Vegas to film some on-location shots for the season premiere.
<blockquote>Today's production headquarters: downtown's Golden Nugget, with scenes planned on the casino floor and in the hotel's Rush Tower.

Cast members making the Vegas trek: original regulars Marg Helgenberger and George Eads, along with returning regular Jorja Fox and newcomer Ted Danson, who takes over as "CSI's" crime lab supervisor following Laurence Fishburne's departure.

[...]

Other planned background locations for today's "CSI" shoot: the Fremont Street Experience, plus Strip-adjacent sites on Tropicana and Hacienda avenues.</blockquote>

If you're in town, hit up the area (politely!) and get some pics if you can.  Bonus points for the first Jorja and Ted picture.
