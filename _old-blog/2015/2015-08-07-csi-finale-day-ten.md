How many days does filming take? On average it's 8 days, not counting post production work (like the CSI effect and the zoom ins and any voice overs). Since they didn't do weekend work, today is day 8 of filming. But. This is a two part episode, and they're _still_ on part one! Which means they're probably around the halfway point.

That said, Zuiker tweeted about having to re-write a B scene (I presume he means a scene for the B plot), so I'd guess this shoot will take longer than normal.

Last night was filming with Eric, Elisabeth (Harnois), and Marg in a multi-level parking lot. So we know the episode includes cars. Nothing about Jorja or Billy, so maybe they finally have a night off. They've been in a lot of scenes though, which bodes well for a very, very, long recap from me!

Meanwhile, Jorja watched the last Jon Stewart episode:

And we'll see what comes next when it comes next.
