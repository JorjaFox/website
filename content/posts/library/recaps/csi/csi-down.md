## Synopsis

The episode concerns Morgan Brody, who is in a helicopter that crashes. The CSIs had been called to a murder in the desert, but 30 minutes before their arrival, the victim (who had no pulse) groans and a rescue chopper is called. Morgan goes on the helicopter to fly to the hospital, intending to continue on to help Nick in Northtown where two gang members from the Mad-10s were killed. En route, it's discovered the victim is actually the perp from Nick's case, Frank Cafferty. Cafferty wakes up on the helicopter and takes it hostage, crashing outside of

Cafferty killed the boyfriend of his daughter, Samantha, and was trying to rescue her. When she turns herself in to the police, it's for the seemingly ulterior motive of helping her father get away. In reality, Samantha wants her father dead, and is still working with the gang, the Mad-10s. The gang shoots the helicopter down, and Morgan, luckily, survives, as does Cafferty. He still has her gun, so they hide from the gang and wait for the police to arrive. After a shootout, Morgan is saved and reunited with her father, Conrad Ecklie.

## Review

Catherine and Sara are in court at the beginning of the episode. When they come back, they help at the lab going over Cafferty's personal life.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Looks like his daughter grew up. Ouch.
