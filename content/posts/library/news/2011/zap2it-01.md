It appears that **Jorja Fox's** on-again, off-again relationship with the long-running CBS hit **"CSI"** is on again. And this time it's permanent ... for now.

The actress who plays crime scene investigator Sara Sidle has signed on as a series regular after four seasons as a guest star, according to a report from TV Line.

Fox has disappeared and re-appeared from the show seemingly as many times as the Miniature Killer that almost took the life of Fox's character. She first was fired from the show after a contract dispute in 2004, only to be rehired shortly thereafter. Fox then quit the show in 2007, telling EW the decision "could be the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Only time will tell." She then returned for a stint in 2008 and continued her guest starring role through the end of last season.

Fox's re-hiring comes just days after show execs announced that the **Ted Danson** would be taking over the lead of "CSI," filling the hole left with **Laurence Fishburne**'s departure.
