## Synopsis

An apparent vehicular-manslaughter case turns into a murder investigation when Grissom discovers that the victim, who was deaf, was actually killed before a car hit him. Also, a shoot-out at a coffee shop, which may have been a professional hit, leaves five people dead, including a local high roller.

## Review

A dead kid is in the street, apparently run over by a car, but Sara notes that the differences in tread marks shows that the victim was hit twice. At the post-mortem, it's noted that the victim is deaf, which leads Sara and Warrick to a local deaf school, where they manage to upset the school president by bringing in an interpreter (when one isn't needed) and then talking to the interpreter rather than directly to the president

They report back to Grissom, who gets them back in, and reminds them that this isn't a case of 'us vs. them' (hearing vs. deaf). Despite what he told Sara earlier, Grissom gets personal with the case. During the interrogation of a suspect, both Sara and Warrick realize that they know very little about Grissom. When Warrick finds lice on the victim's shirt (while Sara's checking out the tread marks in a database), she moves back and tucks her hair behind her ears protectively. At one point, when Greg interrupts to grab Grissom, he waves at Sara and she smiles back at him -- no problems with her colleagues there.

When Grissom mentions that the busted tail light can't be traced because the serial number is incomplete, Sara tells him that she matched it by comparing it to the tread pattern -- later when they're checking out the suspect's car, Sara and Warrick find the final piece of evidence stuck to the muffler.

## Notes

* Sara is just like anyone else, making generalized assumptions about someone different (in this case, the deaf school president before she finds out differently -- at which point she drops her assumptions.
* Sara still flirting with her colleagues, or at least allowing them to flirt with her.
* Sara' feelings about Grissom are known by her coworkers (or at least by Warrick.
* Sara drives yet again.
* Sara's mechanical talents show again as she goes over the car with Warrick.
