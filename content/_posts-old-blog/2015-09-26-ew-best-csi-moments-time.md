A crime involving a victim who was cut into pieces and left in a garbage bin prompts Gil to question whether CSI is the life he really wants (and if he’s meant to be with Sara).</blockquote>
And then he had to:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.ew.com/gallery/csi-best-moments/2316403_%E2%80%9Cliving-doll%E2%80%9D-season-7-episode-24">“Living Doll” (Season 7, episode 24)</a>
