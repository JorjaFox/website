<p>I mean, we all are, right?</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>CSI: Vegas </em>(CBS)</strong></p><p>For a decade, <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> (2000–15) was one of the most watched dramas in the world. The grisly, neon-tinged exploits of a Sin City forensic team captivated viewers with its cutting-edge science, cinematic production values (Quentin Tarantino directed!) and winning ensemble led by William Petersen as “The Bug Man” Gil Grissom. After spawning three spinoffs (<em>Miami</em>, <em>NY</em> and <em>Cyber</em>), the franchise returns to where it all began for this sequel, which finds the Vegas Crime Lab’s new head (Paula Newsome) calling in reinforcements in a crisis. </p><p>Why We’re Excited</p><p>That cavalry includes Petersen, as well as fellow original series costars Wallace Langham, Paul Guilfoyle <em>and</em> Jorja Fox. That means we’ll learn the status of Gil and Sara Sidle’s relationship along with just how much the high-tech world of criminal forensics has changed in six years. By mixing old blood with the new (including Matt Lauria, Mel Rodriguez and Mandeep Dhillon), CBS should hit the jackpot. <em>—Damian Holbrook</em></p><cite>Credit: <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1001781/fall-2021-tv-preview-law-order-for-the-defense-csi-vegas-ncis-hawaii-fbi-international/">‘CSI: Vegas,’ ‘NCIS: Hawaii’ &amp; More Spinoffs of Your Fave Procedurals Coming This Fall</a></cite></blockquote>
