<a href="http://www.earthhour.org"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/03/earthhour.jpg" alt="earthhour" title="earthhour" width="150" height="127" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1702" /></a> In 2007, 2.2 million homes and businesses switched off their lights for one hour in Sydney, Australia.  In 2008, 50 million people joined in, including landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Rome’s Colosseum, the Sydney Opera House and the Coca Cola billboard in Times Square.

Now it's 2009 and the goal is to have 1 billion people switching off their lights, and "vote" for the Earth.

VOTE EARTH by simply switching off your lights for one hour and join the world for Earth Hour.  The lights-out will be sort of a rolling wave, from East to West, so turn off the lights in YOUR timezone (not 8:30pm ET, but 8:30pm wherever you are).

**Saturday, March 28, 8:30-9:30pm.**
