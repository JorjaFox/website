<a href="http://www.davidrambo.com/"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2008/12/davidrambo-150x150.png" alt="David Rambo" title="David Rambo" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-942" style="float:left;margin:5px;" /></a> That was a mouthful!  David Rambo is perhaps best known for his first <em>CSI</em> script, "Butterflied."  Since then, he has become the favorite author of all GSR scripts (well, him and Sara Goldfinger, of course).  Always friendly with fans, David's been known to reply, personally, to emails and letters.  He even granted <a href="http://savingsarasidle.com">Saving Sara Sidle</a> an interview about his favorite episodes, Warrick's death, Billy Petersen's departure and, of course, Grissom and Sara.

Remember: "There is no such thing as reading too far into any details."
