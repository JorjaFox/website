Like a movie called "How I Became An Elephant", which is about a plan to help prevent elephants from becoming extinct in the wild.  We only have about 15 years left, at the current rate elephants are being killed for their ivory. You can read up on all the details at <a href="http://www.howibecameanelephant.com">http://www.howibecameanelephant.com</a>, where they have a blog and email list.  They also have a nascent Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/HIBAELEPHANT">@HIBAELEPHANT</a> and some video clips.

I will warn you.  You will probably cry a little when you watch this.
