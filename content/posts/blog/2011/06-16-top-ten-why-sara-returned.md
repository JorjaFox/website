So I was sitting around musing about things and joked 'What's the silliest reason Sara came back to Vegas.'  Right away, we had the number one reason, but I then decided I should see if we could come up with ten.

So in the greatest Letterman tradition, here are your top ten reasons to explain why Sara Sidle came back to Las Vegas!

10. Gil snores.
9. She had a couple thousand dollars in casino chips to trade in.
8. She missed the really cheap, all you can eat buffets. _(from Staci32)_
7. It's easier to have straight hair when you're in _dry_ heat!
6. She's tired of doing laundry in the jungle. _(from VegaWriters)_
5. You can't get Reeses Peanut Butter Cups in France. _(from KaseyOnline)_
4. There's no internet access in a Costa Rican Jungle, and she's addicted to Brass' Twitter account.
3. Where else can you wear that sexy Elvis costume?
2. What happens in Vegas ... needs to happen again in Vegas.

And the number one reason Sara came back to Vegas is ....

1. The beard itches.

All non-credited suggestions came from friends and family.
