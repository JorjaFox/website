## Synopsis

Sara and Nick work the case of the children and wife of a marijuana dispensary owner who are abducted. As he scrambled to get the money for their safe return, the security guard noticed and shoot the abductor's messenger. Curiously, the dead woman has no fingerprints and no ID so she cannot be identified easily. When they do track her down, she too was being blackmailed into the work, her brother having been kidnapped and later killed. The CSIs are able to track down the van to the kidnapper's location, only to find the wife of the dispensary owner had orchestrated the entire thing.

Meanwhile, Russell and Finn continue to work on the Gig Harbor case, and Finn goes up to Seattle.

## Review

Sara and Nick work the majority of the case. Sara is a little bit of a square, not seeing the big deal between strains of marijuana. She also gets into Remi Volero's face, convinced he's key to the crime.

## Notes

* Sara still doesn't recognize marijuana very well and doesn't understand the big deal between brands.

## Quotes

**Sara:** There was this guy who lived in my dorm in college, everybody used to call him Space Bob. Your lab smells like his room. That's not a compliment to either of you.
