There was a point when I expected Tina to complain about her life, and remarked "Honey, Sara's mom shot and killed her father. Then Sara finally gets the love of her life, only to be kidnapped and left to die under a car in the desert in a torrential downpour, burnt out, and had to leave Vegas. And you wonder why she didn't come around more often? Puh-lease." But Sara's much nicer than I am.

Oh and something something parallel story about the crime king's son blah blah blah. Not my best recap, I know. I wasn't really watching the scenes without Sara.
