## In Praise of CSI's Happy Ending

**Question:** Several years ago, I wrote to you regarding my extreme disappointment in _CSI_ for divorcing Grissom and Sara, the series' "long ship" known as GSR. Well, you were the voice of reason, saying that you hoped William Petersen would be back for the end. Thankfully, you were right. Although I still think they should not have been separated, the end of the finale was oh so satisfying. Grissom and Sara sailing off into the sunset was a much-welcomed cliché. The finale was good, old-school _CSI_ with lots of throwbacks to the past, and the ending was absolutely beautiful. Nicely done for a show about death. The onscreen magic of Petersen and Jorja Fox will be missed, but the memories now are all good ones. Thanks to the cast and crew, and to Anthony Zuiker, for making it happen. — _Jen_

**Matt Roush:** Even if the sailing off into the sunset fadeout was a bit corny, it seemed appropriate, and most important, satisfying to the fans. When wrapping up a show with this much history and baggage, giving the faithful viewer a payoff should be a top priority. (Are you listening, _Castle_?) If Grissom hadn't come back for the final chapter, it would have been much more disappointing for everyone. So kudos for sure.
