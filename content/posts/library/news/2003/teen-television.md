CSI: Crime Scene Investigation stars Jorja Fox and Gary Dourdan have become best friends after the actor delayed a promotional trip to Europe to wait for his sick pal. Fox claims the cast of the hit show have been close from the beginning, but when Dourdan gave up his dream trip to Europe to help nurse the actress back to full health when she caught the flu, she knew that he was extra special.

She says, "I got really sick. I thought maybe I should cancel the trip, but Gary waited for me.

"We took a later flight and he practically carried me to Europe."
