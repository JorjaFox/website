Boots are a fashion must-have this fall and Earth has styles to accompany the biggest fall fashion looks as reported by Style.com, the online home of Vogue and W. The "Summit" is an over-the-calf, butter-soft Nubuk leather design with fleece trim and full-length laces traveling from the top to the bottom of the boot, blending the Boho and the fur (or faux fur) looks that are all the rage. The "Alaska" also features fur trim with leather laces that wrap the boot to customize the fit and add style. "The Wrangler" follows the New Frontier trend in Earth's version of the cowboy boot, which is accented with embroidered flowers. The versatile suede "Mirage" in Bark Brown, Beaver Tan, Lime green and Wine is also available in animal-friendly faux suede micro-fiber. The "Tofu," another animal-friendly faux suede vegan style, is casual with plush fleece linings to keep toes toasty and comes in khaki, tan and pink. Earth boot styles feature elasticized stretch-gores or adjustable lacing systems to accommodate varying calf sizes, and so that you can tuck jeans into them, which is another great look this fall.

Celebrities such as Diane Lane, Salma Hayek, Marcia Cross, Amber Tamblyn, Jorja Fox and Tyra Banks have all put in their orders for the sought-after Earth boots this fall. [...]
