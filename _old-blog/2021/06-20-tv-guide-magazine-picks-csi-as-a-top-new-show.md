After I read the article, I thought "Huh, what did they originally say about _CSI_?" and to my surprise, they didn't. Yes, there's a blurb in the TV Guide Magazine (then just TV Guide - they split into two entities in 2008) Fall preview, but ... Back in September 2000, the show that everyone thought would be a hit was the remake of _The Fugitive_, and _CSI_ was dumped on the Friday Night Death Slot.

In fact...

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">**We Say:** If only the characters were as animated as the evidence. The detective work is often gripping, but the detectives are mired in cliché, including the always terrific Marg Helgenberger (_China Beach_) as a conflicted single mom. Wasting actors like her and Petersen would be a crime. (Jorja Fox, last seen protecting the first daughter on The West Wing, joins _CSI_ in the second episode.)<cite><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/news/2000/tv-guide/">Source: TV Guide Magazine, by Matt Roush</a></cite></blockquote>

Yikes. And hilariously, it was a year later that Roush put _CSI_ on his “Best of the Year 2001” list.

This year, though, they sing a different tune:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">**WHY WE’RE EXCITED** That cavalry includes Petersen, as well as fellow original series costars Wallace Langham, Paul Guilfoyle _and_ Jorja Fox. That means we’ll learn the status of Gil and Sara Sidle’s relationship along with just how much the high-tech world of criminal forensics has changed in six years. By mixing old blood with the new (including Matt Lauria, Mel Rodrigues and Mandeep Dhillon), CBS should hit the jackpot.<cite><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/news/2021/tvguidemagazine-20210617/">Source: TV Guide Magazine, by Damian Holbrook</a></cite></blockquote>

It's impossible to know if _CSI_ can bottle lightning twice, but frankly I'm looking forward to the challenge.
