We have some spoilers, but let's do the news first.

<a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/former_csi_star_william_petersen/259822?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories">William Petersen and Gina Cirone are the proud parents of _twins_!</a>  Billy already has a daughter (who's my age!) and these babies were born via surrogate.

Now on to spoilers.

**STOP READING HERE if you don't want to know.**

<blockquote>**<a href="http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ted-danson/176332">Ted Danson</a> isn't the only new face on _<a href="http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/csi-crime-scene-investigation/100100">CSI</a>_ this season. What can you tell me about how the show will use new series regular <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/elisabeth-harnois/148906">Elisabeth Harnois</a>? — _Kelly_
ADAM: **First things first. Before Harnois' Morgan can work in the lab, she has to patch things up with her estranged father (and new boss) Conrad Ecklie. That's no cakewalk. "He's a better man now... but years ago he wasn't as good a father," executive producer <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/carol-mendelsohn/225945">Carol Mendelsohn</a> says. "It's very hard for her to see that he's a changed man." Perhaps he'll win her over when he comes to her rescue early in the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>**Question: I need some _CSI_ spoilers, please. —Sharp
Ausiello:** There still seems to be some confusion among fans whether Ted Danson is in fact coming in as a new supervisor, since Catherine was the leader last season. Well, I can confirm that Danson’s D.B. Russell is _definitely_ in charge when the season starts and Catherine is _not_ happy about it. She blames Nick for her demotion because of how he handled the Haskell imbroglio.</blockquote>
