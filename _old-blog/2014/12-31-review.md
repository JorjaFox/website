We've made it another year!

This weekend, my wife and I were arguing as to how long this site has been around. The absolute birth would be Jan/Feb 1996, since that's when I was in college and made the site for homework. I can't remember how early the class was, but I know for sure than by the time I <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2010/jorja-invited-jfo-to-spotlight-humane-chicago/" title="Jorja invited JFO to Spotlight Humane: Chicago">saw Jorja at the Humane Society in 2010</a>, the site was about 14. Jorja and I couldn't remember if it was 14 or 16 though, and bounced around those years for a moment, but thinking clearly I know when I was in university, so there you are.

We will be 19 this year. Close enough.

<h2>Highlight of 2014?</h2>

For me it's obvious. <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/jfo-csi/" title="JFO on CSI">Getting to be on the set of CSI</a> was the best part of 2014. I had a great time, and while I'm sure Jorja was worried about me being bored, but I have to tell you that I find the entire filming process fascinating. Getting to hang out with Jorja and George was also awesome. He's a darling, and I wish him the best of luck in whatever he does next.

For the site, I have to say it's a tie between <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/dead-woods-recap-screencap/" title="Dead Woods Recap and Screencap">Dead Woods</a> and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/bad-blood-screencaps-recap/" title="Bad Blood Screencaps and Recap">Bad Blood</a>. Those two episodes were amazingly wonderful Sara episodes.

<h2>Cool stat of 2014?</h2>

Jorja Fans are from all over the world!
