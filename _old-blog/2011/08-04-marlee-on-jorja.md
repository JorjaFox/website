<blockquote>**CSI Files**: Your character obviously interacted with Sara Sidle the most. How did you and **Jorja Fox** spend your downtime while being on set?

**Matlin**: May I say, Jorja kicks ass! She was GREAT to work with. We hit it off immediately and we kept saying, “can we have more scenes together?” She loved learning the dirty signs from me… I’m bad, I know. I’d work with her again in a heartbeat.</blockquote>
