From [CBS Press Express](http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=42646):

> the two-hour series finale farewell for CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION on Sunday, Sept. 27, reuniting original cast members including William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger.

Pause.

Wow.

> To start the season, CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION will have a special two-hour series finale farewell. Then, CSI: CYBER will move in at 10:00 PM to carry on the CSI legacy, with Emmy Award winner Ted Danson joining Academy Award winner Patricia Arquette on the cast.

Wait. WHAT!? Ted Danson is joining <em>CSI: Cyber</em>?

I officially have no idea what's going on, but hey look! <em>GRISSOM!!!!</em>
