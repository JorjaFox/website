## Synopsis

An anonymous phone call informs 911 that a man is dead in his house. When the CSIs arrive, they find a dead Hayden Bradford, who puts new meaning to the term hirsute. Hayden had Hypertrichosis, and was killed via a silver bullet through the heart.

Warrick and Sara explore the inside of the house and find that a woman named Michelle (who had called Hayden 6 times that night) was in pictures and appeared to be his girlfriend. Also, casinodan@gmail.com had sent threatening emails to Dan about a debt. Outside, Catherine and Nick find a broken window, a rock with a print, and a buried gun.

At the lab, Archie traces down Casino Dan, and when Warrick and Greg interview him, he claims that Hayden had lost $10,000 on Dan's poker site. Hayden claimed credit card fraud when he started loosing and stuck Dan with the bill. After Dan leaves, Warrick notices the trace from his shoes seems to resemble that from the crime scene.

The print from the rock belongs to a man named Brent, who claims to be Hayden's best friend and Michelle's brother. When Michelle is eventually tracked down, she was brokenhearted.

Sofia and Sara check out the phone booth where the 911 call was made from, though Sofia arrives first and prints the booth without Sara. Sofia also points out the large quantity of hair that seems to have been 'shedded' on the ground. Sara takes this to the lab, where the hair is determined to be that of Hayden's twin sister, Allison. That said, there is no paper trail at all for Alison.

Back at the house, Catherine finds a secret room in the house where the sister lives. Allison has been hiding in her room for years, never coming out and never talking to people. Her father ran off years ago and the mother was dead. When Hayden was shot, she'd been hiding in her room, and only came out at midnight to call the police, in the hopes they wouldn't find her.

Grissom feels bad for Allison, sympathizing with her desire not to be seen as a freak. Nick agrees, and says that Hayden was looking for their mom, who wasn't dead but left them when the twins were teenagers. The mother comes to the station and tells Grissom that she realized she had to leave so that Allison wouldn't always depend on her, and so she faked her death. Now it was too late to go back.

Meanwhile, Casino Dan's trace connects him to the crime scene. He admits he came by to hassle Hayden about the money, but only looked in the window. When Dan saw Hayden (and Hayden saw Dan), he freaked out and ran off because Hayden was a freak.

The autopsy (which takes a long time, because all of Hayden's hair had to be shaved off first) suggests Hayden was killed in Allison's room. A check of her room finds blood stains under the bed. Allison confesses that Hayden had actually been shot in her room: he'd come in, asked for her gun (which she'd buried outside) and then been shot. Allison saw the face of Hayden's killer reflected in her TV: Brent.

Brent confesses to the murder, saying that his family blamed him for Hayden and Michelle being engaged, and he did it all to protect Michelle. Michelle admits she suspected Brent had killed Hayden, but he'd threatened her to keep her quiet.

In the end, Allison has enough money to take care of herself, but tells Catherine her greatest secret. Allison knew her mother was never dead.

The episode ends with Mrs. Bradford knocking on the door to Allison's house.

## Review

Sara's most interesting scene is when she meets Sofia by the phone booth. Sofia is irritable and pushy and angry, while Sara is mild and calm. The disparity between the characters shows a depth of calm that Sara didn't always have. Sara doesn't comment about Sofia tampering with evidence at the scene (processing when she shouldn't have been).
