Once again, I'll update the post Saturday night, once I have screencaps etc.  Yeah, **Saturday** night. This should be the last week I'm out and about on a Thursday night (it's <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday6.htm">Simchat Torah</a>). If someone else wants to write up a recap, post it in the comments here or email it to webmaster@jorjafox.net and great thanks will be yours! Until then, don't blow things up.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
Hysteria ensues when a shark attacks a woman in the pool at a Las Vegas casino "day club," and the CSIs must determine if the killer is human or shark.

So ... That was a very cute episode, not a great one again, but a cute one.  Two stars for very Jorja Lite.
