## Summary

Third-year med student Lucy Knight reports to the ER. Doug hits the nail on the head when he describes her as a 'hit-the-book' student. Lucy's first day finds her informing a wife of her husbands terminal condition, comforting a pregnant woman, getting locked on the roof and trying to figure out Kerry Weaver's 'Tour on Tape.' Greene extends a protective wing over Lucy, who's forced to endure Carter's irritation. However, asked to insert an IV, Lucy requires Carol's help.

## Review

Doyle is seen suturing a drunk guy. Near the end of the episode, Lucy's fellow student, Bernard, is assigned to work with Doyle, while Lucy is assigned to Carter.
