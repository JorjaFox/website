Remember all the way back in October when Jorja went to Hawaii? (Everyone in the snow-filled midwest and the east are grumbling now, sorry... is now the time to tell you it's in the 70s where I live in California?) Ahem, anyway, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Matt.Jisa/media_set?set=a.10151911331523320.1073741842.588853319&amp;type=3">Matt Jisa</a> got to meet Jorja while in Hawaii, since he helped promote the film "Lion Ark."

Nothing like starting out the new year with some older photos of warm places, I say! Now-- Hey, put down the pitchforks! Aaaaaah!
