**20. Gil/Sara/Lady Heather, 'CSI""

**History:** Forensic examiner Gil Grissom (William Petersen) isn't exactly lucky with the ladies. Dominatrix-turned-therapist Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) only comes into his life when she's a murder suspect, when her daughter is murdered and when her kinky past is helpful to Grissom in solving a case.
