As usual, speculate and spoil yourselves. <del datetime="2010-04-23T02:27:21+00:00">I'll update the post once I have screencaps etc.</del>  Updated!

<h2>Official Release</h2>
<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/worldsend-002-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="worldsend-002" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2363" /> When a student is discovered murdered at Lindsey's school, the investigation takes a sharp turn when the CSIs uncover an unlikely connection between the boy's death and atrocities of the past.

This one gets three stars. Not a whole lot of Sara, predictable plot, but good Sara moments and great acting.  Two fantastic scenes (one with Brass and one with Lindsey) made this a winner.  Or at least a good enough.
