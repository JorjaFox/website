CBS's Watch magazine is an in-house magazine to promote their shows. You can actually get it <a href="https://connect.cbswatchmagazine.com/free/">delivered for free</a> in a lot of places. But for those who can't, it's available online at <a href="https://cbswatchmagazine.com">CBSWatchMagazine.com</a>.

This year's Fall Preview (which has two covers) has a major article about <em>CSI: Vegas</em>. In that article, they interviewed Paula Newsome, Mandeep Dillon, and (of course) Jorja Fox.

Our big takes:

<ul><li>Jorja's been working behind the camera a lot more since <em>CSI</em> went off the air.</li><li>Sara is more chill! "Now there’s a lightness of being with her," says Jorja, which comes from Sara's work for the planet.</li><li>Yes, Grissom and Sara are still married, and for those who didn't know, yes, Jorja knew from day one that Sara was a love interest. That pesky popularity of CSI slowed things down.</li><li>The new series is more action-y than before, and goes off like a bottle rocket.</li></ul>

And yes, of course, for those who need the text to translate, we've got a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/news/2021/1001-cbswatch/">text-only copy of the Jorja parts up in the library</a>.
