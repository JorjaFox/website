Last Thursday marked the departure of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) from the long-running hit drama "CSI."

Appearing as a guest co-host on "The View" this week, Fox says she's "fortunate" to have been a part of the series. She went on to say that the decision to leave was "the hardest decision I ever made."

The actress is an original cast member from debut season in 2000, as a quasi love interest for lead investigator Gil Grissom.

Her departure was featured in an episode entitled "Goodbye and Goodnight." Sidle revisits an earlier case in which killer got away.

Over the course of the investigation, Sidle's mind grows dark and bleak - and she finally makes it clear why she decides to leave the CSI crew.

Fox didn't say much about what she has planned next and says she "wants to breathe for a second and take a look around."

The actress also joked that now that she's left the show, she can now "date the cast." She didn't say which actor she had in mind.

Last season "CSI" ended with a cliffhanger ending which left Sidle's life in question. Fox reportedly did not show up to film the episode because she was upset at having her character killed off.

The actress returned to film the first eight episodes of this season and producers have indicated her character may return in the future.
