You may have noticed the gallery got some new tweaks today.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/gallery-upgrade/mainpage/" rel="attachment wp-att-4732"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/06/mainpage-230x153.png" alt="New Thumbnail Sizes" title="New Thumbnail Sizes" width="230" height="153" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4732" /></a>First up, you get better thumbnails. The server can handle it, they're easier for you to see what image you're after, it's great. While I did this, I dumped (most) of the watermarks. You're welcome. The bigger thumbnails means I'm still working out some of the kinks with the layouts for albums, especially ones with really long names, but so far I'm very happy with the new look.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/gallery-upgrade/colorbox2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4734"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4734" title="What colorbox looks like" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/06/colorbox2-230x118.png" alt="What colorbox looks like" width="230" height="118" /></a>Second is colorbox. This is one of those nifty tools that lets you load images without having to load the full-page. It requires javascript. If you don't have that, it kicks you to the image itself. When you load a colorbox, it looks like this, with the page 'hidden' in grey behind.

A few points to note about colorbox:
<ol>
	<li>The link to the 'full sized' is the real like to full sized images. The one to 'image page' takes you to the old image page, in case you want to link someone to one specific image.</li>
	<li>Your keyboard's arrow keys (left and right) work as navigation, and are _much faster_ than clicking the old next/previous links.</li>
	<li>The escape button closes colorbox (so does clicking the x or anywhere outside the colorbox area - i.e. that black area).</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/gallery-upgrade/download-album/" rel="attachment wp-att-4735"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4735" title="Download as zip" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/06/download-album-230x182.jpg" alt="Download as zip" width="230" height="182" /></a>You can't open up a million images at once anymore. Instead I made you something even nicer. A link to download the album as a zip. You'll _only_ see it on the final album (so you can't download the whole server's images at once). If you abuse this, it'll go away so please remember that the more times you download, the more money you cost me. Be responsible.</li>
</ol>
So there you go! Remember, you're always free to use the images from JFO for your own sites. All I ask is you link back here to credit. If I've credited someone else, credit them instead. That way, everyone's happy.
