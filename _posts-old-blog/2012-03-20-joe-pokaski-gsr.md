Do you remember this guy? Joe Pokaski? Used to work on this little show called _Heroes_, came over to CSI?

Anyway, he gives us a tiny tidbit as to what to expect tomorrow night!
<blockquote>**CSI Files**: There’s word that Gil Grissom will somehow factor into the episode. Will there be an appearance by**William Petersen** before the end of the season?

**Pokaski**: I can’t speak to the end of the season (or I might not make it past it myself), but part of Wednesday night’s story is dedicated to understanding Married life between Sara [Sidle, **Jorja Fox**] and Grissom. How it works, and why it works. And the last image in that sub-story makes me smile every time I see it.</blockquote>
