You're surprised we're getting this already? Don't be! They start filming next week.

Okay, how about a title and a brief?
<blockquote>The CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Season 4 Premiere will be called "The Devil and D.B. Russell"

With Morgan and Ellie's lives on the line, the CSIs race to stop a serial killer from completing his twisted homage to "Dante's Inferno".</blockquote>

For those of you who are too young to know, the title is an homage to a story (and later play and movie) called "The Devil and Daniel Webster" whereby a lawyer (Daniel Webster) talks his way out of a case with the Devil and wins. Interestingly, he technically lost the case based on evidence. Wonder what _that_ implies of this episode...

Don't say I don't love ya.
