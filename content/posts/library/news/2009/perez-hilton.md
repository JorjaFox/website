**Jorja Fox** will be returning to "CSI" in its upcoming season.

It's been a rocky relationship for Fox and "CSI", with the actress leaving and returning once before over salary and contract disputes.

Her return will only be temporary, as she's just signed on to star in a handful of episodes for the season. Thus far.

We'd advise her not to look a gift horse in the mouth this time!
