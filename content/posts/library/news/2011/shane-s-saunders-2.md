This season on *CSI* multiple actors have been in-and-out of episodes, most notably **Marg Helgenberger** (Catherine Willows), **Jorja Fox** (Sara Sidle), and **Paul Guilfoyle** (Captain Jim Brass). As the season grows closer to the finish line *CSI* writer **Christopher Barbour** reveals who will be missing from the final 5 episodes and says: "I sincerely hope fans of all the characters will tune in to each and every episode. It'll be quite a ride to the end of the season."

Episode 18 this season will feature the entire cast; episode 19 will have series regulars Marg Helgenberger and **Eric Szmanda** (Greg Sanders) M.I.A.; the following episode regulars Jorja Fox and Wallace Langham (Hodges) will not be present; episode 21 Paul Guilfoyle and **David Berman** (David Phillips) will not be present; and in the season finale you can look forward to seeing the entire cast.
