These puns aren't going to write themselves! That's... probably a good thing. Well anyway, how about some more, big, pictures of Jorja? Yeah, I knew you'd like that. By the way, major shout-out to Lauren T. Cox, who gave me two more images from that 2003 People Magazine photo-shoot, because <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/magazine-memories-monday/">yesterday's just weren't enough</a>! Sorry about the watermarking.

I really dig the lighting in the PETA shot.
