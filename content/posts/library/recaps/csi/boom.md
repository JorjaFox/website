## Synopsis

Grissom, Warrick and Sara investigate a bombing that occurred in the lobby of a Las Vegas business building; Nick spends the night with a prostitute who is later found murdered in her house and he becomes the chief suspect, and only Catherine can exonerate him.

## Review

At the bomb scene, Sara is wrapped up against the cold. Sara and Catherine examine the bomb debris at the lab, then Grissom has Sara check out an orange substance melted on to the clock gear of the timing device. Grissom is experimenting with alarm clocks, trying to find out what type was used in the bomb when Sara walks in with information pulled from the bomb database, listing what the most popular brand of clock is for timing devices.

Sara and Grissom blowing up bombs to determine the container components (Sara seems to get a little kick out of this). Sara determines that the orange substance is polyester. Another bomb goes off, and Sara takes an orange jacket from a worker at the scene. Sara discovers the jacket material is identical to that of the melted goo in the bomb, and searches the database for that company to find a disgruntled (and out of work) employee. Sara and Brass arrest the disgruntled former employee.

## Notes

* Sara appears to be a little more helpful than usual when it comes to Grissom.
