**Interviewer:** What are some tips you have to going green?

**Jorja Fox:** Going green? Oh, wow, I love it. Well, you know, start with the simple stuff. There's some very simple things you can do. Recycling, obviously, I think we're all doing that in California. I'm amazed. I go visit some of my family members across the country, and they don't have recycling centers yet. And most of them are doing it themselves anyway. I am a big believer in reusing, you know what I mean. Everything down to like shopping for clothes and stuff, everything you want is probably already out there already anyway. Go to a secondhand store or a thrift shop, and rather than buy something new, buy something that's already still cool.
