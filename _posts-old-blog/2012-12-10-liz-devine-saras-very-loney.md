GSR fans, breathe. You're okay. Doug isn't a threat to GSR. But he's indicative of the problems born from long distance relationships.
<blockquote>**CSI Files**: With Doug Wilson (**Josh Randall**) entering the picture does it seem on first blush that he is a threat to their marriage?

**Devine**: We’re not playing it as that right _now_, but it’s more of a realization that she’s not getting what she needs out of the relationship with Grissom [**William Petersen**] being so far away. This is a person that she had a relationship before coming to the crime lab in Vegas and it went well, and we don’t know why they didn’t pursue it but some probably think it’s because she moved to Vegas to work at the Las Vegas Crime Lab. He comes back in the picture and she sees that she can be attracted to somebody and deserves to have someone to be around. Grissom’s not there and she’s very lonely. I think it’s pretty obvious in her expressions that this has been a hard time apart for her.</blockquote>

That said, some people naturally do better at it than others. Grissom, being a pretty anti-social sort of guy, is okay being away for long periods of time. Sara connects to people more, and is very likely missing that connection with the one guy she loves more than anyone else.
