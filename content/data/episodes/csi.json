    "summary": " Grissom has to give a lecture on preserving crime scenes at an out-of-town convention and Catherine is off to Reno for the evening, so he makes Warrick acting supervisor. The night begins routinely enough with the murder outside of a casino. The dead man was a con artist, who had run off with some tourists' money only to get shot and killed in the parking lot. Things heat up quickly when it's discovered that the dead man was part of a drug ring. He was also scheduled to fly to Baja with Capt. Brass's estranged daughter, Ellie, who turns out to be quite a spitfire---and does everything she can to humiliate her father. With his daughter as the prime suspect, Brass takes himself off the investigation professionally, but not personally. Meanwhile, the physical evidence in the case leads Sara to investigate a high-end counterfeit operation after the money found on the victim turns out to be bogus."

The latest slaying matches Millander's previous killings in that it recreates his father's murder, which Millander witnessed as a boy. In each case, the victim is shot once through the chest while lying in a bathtub. A nearby tape recorder contains the person's supposed suicide message. All three victims share the same birthday of Aug. 17---the date Millander's father was slain---with the years in descending order from 1959. So presumably, the killer's next target was born Aug. 17, 1956...which just happens to be Grissom's birthday."
