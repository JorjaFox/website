<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4595" title="Dune and Gloom" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/05/dunegloom-review-230x153.jpg" alt="Dune and Gloom" width="230" height="153" />Can we say <strong>five</strong> stars? I think we can. This was amazing, a great episode for Jorja. They even mentioned her mom! If you didn't closely watch that amazingly nuanced scene with Ted Danson, where Russell starts talking about mental illness, go back. You can actually see Sara start to pull away, being uncomfortable and avoiding like she used to be. But then, as Russell tells her about his cousin, she comes back a little, until finally we get to see some of her character growth. Sara can talk about the craziness that was her mother. It blew my mind.

The whole episode was filled with subtle moments, little shout-outs to Sara's past. Falling for the sob-story of the old guy? Classic Sara. being raging when she figured out she was played? Also classic. It goes on and on. It kills me a little because I know Jorja (and Ted) won't any Emmy nods for their dramatic chops in episodes like this. Really though, to take a procedural and elevate it like they did... Well. It's moments like this that I'm very glad I run this site.

Jeffery Hunt was giving a livet-weet as the show aired, and here are the Jorja tidbits.
