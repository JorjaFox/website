It took so long for me to post this because I kept cracking up every time I caught Marlee Matlin signing that Julia and Grissom were intimate.  The sign is, indeed, the one for being 'involved' (thank you Mrs. Ipstenu for confirming), but her face pretty much turns that into 'Yeah, I banged him. A lot.' I'm kind of in love Marlee right now.  And Jorja's face of 'Yes, thank you, I get it.' is priceless.

You want to SEE the video?  Oh, sure.

<del datetime="2011-01-28T13:24:34+00:00">By the way, the CTV promo (waiting on it) had Grissom in it. So ... apparently he's around too on a Skype video. That's really all I know at this time.</del>

Thank you, UnspokenLoves for the clip of the CTV video! There's Grissom.
