Pretty much everyone interviewed for CSI lately has assured GSR fans that Grissom and Sara are happy, content, and just weird in their own funky way.  I wouldn't ask for it any other way, personally.  Producer Allen MacDonald, when interviewed by fansite CSI Files, tossed out a meaty tidbit about a certain someone who will be returning to the set of CSI.  No, it's not Grissom.

<blockquote><strong>CSI Files:</strong> Are you at work on a new episode now? Can you hint at what it might be about?

<strong>MacDonald:</strong> I am. And the only hint I can provide is that it would be the completion of a CSI storyline trilogy involving Sara Sidle and a very, very smart young girl. </blockquote>

Ask me? It's Hannah West all the way, baby!
