    **Last Updated: 7 Aug 2024** -- TL;DR? We had to remove the gallery to prevent legal action.
{{< /alert >}}

Hello! We bet you're here looking for that old, multi-gigabyte, gallery or the random videos we had saved.

Well, we are sad to say it's no more.

It breaks our hearts to have had to remove it, and Mika fought a valiant battle, but the reality was we always knew the gallery was living on borrowed time. While we certainly had the rights to most of the publicity images, screencaps are in a legally murky territory. We can use them, in small amounts, but not the massive screencaps we had before.

The videos were even more clearly not okay. We tried with smaller clips, but the end was a no-go.

As of 2024, Mika has been tirelessly working on slowly importing publicity galleries to all the recaps she can, and will go from there. But it's going to be a long haul. Don't panic, though! Everything is saved and we have good backups, but it's not going to be as it was.
