## Synopsis

A shoot out during a robbery at a mom and son gun shop leads to a dead mother killed by a mysterious guy in a red shirt, while a body is dumped down a ravine and cozily wrapped in a blanket. The gun shop sells illegal gun parts on the side and the killer of the dummped body was one of the attempted robbers of the gun shop.

Carrie Warren is thrown from her own car by Sam Trent, her on again/off again boyfriend, after he attempted to kill himself at her house (but threw up) and accidentally poisoned her dog Roscoe. When Carrie found him and Roscoe, apparently dead, she shoot herself with the gun Carrie's neighbor, John Rakow, had given her to protect herself from Sam, accidentally killing her dog and grazing herself badly.

When Sam woke up, not dead, he wrapped the injured Carrie in a quilt and drove her to the hospital, but Carrie was accidentally thrown from the car, struck her head, and died. Sam tucked her in with the quilt and walked to the gun shop, hoping to kill himself there, but ends up walking away unscathed. He goes to their favorite spot in Las Vegas and plans jumps off the deck, but Carrie's neighbor, John, saves him but wants to shoot him. As soon as John lets go of Sam, he jumps back to the railing.

Sara is unable to talk him out of jumping, but she managed to stall enough for the emergency rescue team to fill an airbag and save Sam's life.

## Review

Sara and Catherine work the initial body dump scene and investigate the car when it's found. As the two cases become interrelated, Sara works with Greg and Bobby as they match the guns. She interviews Carrie's neighbor, John Rakow, with Brass, and confirms his innocence with Ray. Ray and Sara go to search their Sam's, house, where they find the photos and letters, confirming Sam and Carrie's relationship.

Sara makes the connection of how much money Sam asked his father for, and where he might spend the $8 dollars. It's the cost to take the elevator to the viewing deck at the Ivory Tower which Sam and Carrie liked to visit. Sara and Ray manage to talk John out of shooting Sam, but not Sam out of jumping.

## Notes

* Sara teases Catherine about her friendliness with Detective Vartann, intimating at a relationship between the two.
* Sara is comfortable with Ray, cheerfully teasing him about taking him to terrible hotels in Las Vegas, like the Ivory Tower.
