The CSI team shows up for a wedding and stays for a murder on tonight's episode of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," airing at 9 p.m. on CBS. The action begins when Grissom (WILLIAM PETERSEN), Nick Stokes (GEORGE EADS), Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX) and Captain Jim Brass (PAUL GUILFOYLE) attend a wedding at which the groom's mother is murdered.

"It is a fascinating, sort of character-driven, dark comedy which we rarely do," Jorja tells ET. "What we have is the case of a successful defense attorney, who has represented a lot of less than upstanding characters, who meets a very unpleasant demise at her son's wedding. We try to put the events together, who killed her and why. Of course, there is a twist at the end."

The matter is complicated by the fact that the woman (played by guest star VERONICA CARTWRIGHT) is not popular with a majority of the wedding guests; plus, several of the less-than-upstanding characters that Jorja mentioned are high-level mobsters.

It takes the CSI team 11 hours to interview all 200 witnesses and collect the evidence from the murder scene, so a very exhausted Sara, Nick and Greg Sanders (ERIC SZMANDA) stop for breakfast. Then, Nick's car is stolen - along with all the evidence.

"One of the things I love about this script is that the people at the crime scene, including [the CSIs], recount the events of the wedding, so you get a different flavor of what people see and what their perceptions are," Jorja continues. "We have to recount the events because something happens to all of our evidence. Those perspectives are kind of unique considering we all work together and spend a lot of time together. They are all flavored with our own styles and thoughts. I laughed my head off when I read the script, so I hope the audience will, too."

According to Jorja, Sara hates weddings, which is something they have in common. "I am not really acting in this episode, I just show up," says the 37-year-old single actress, who admits she has commitment issues. "Deep down inside, I think there is a romantic that lives inside Sara, but I think she thinks that a lot of people get married for the wrong reason and the wrong way and this wedding is a good example."
