CBS published their press release for Season 11 up on CBS PressExpress.  Since only people in the US can see that, here's a copy of the relevant bit:

> **STARRING:**
>
> Marg Helgenberger...................... Catherine Willows
> Laurence Fishburne...............Dr. Raymond Langston
> George Eads...................................... Nick Stokes
> Paul Guilfoyle................................Capt. Jim Brass
> Eric Szmanda...................................Greg Sanders
> Robert David Hall...................... Dr. Albert Robbins
> David Berman.................................David Phillips
> Wallace Langham............................David Hodges

You may notice that Jorja's name _is not_ listed.  And yet we have seen photos of her on set!  What does that mean?  It means we're back to special guest/recurring status for another season.
