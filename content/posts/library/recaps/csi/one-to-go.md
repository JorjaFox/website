## Synopsis

Dr. Raymond Langston joins the CSI team, on retainer, to help solve the 'Dick & Jane' murders. One of his students is accomplice to Nathan Haskill, the already convicted killer. Knowing that this is Grissom's last case in the lab, the team avows to solve this one for him.

In the end, Langston is offered a position as a CSI, Ecklie becomes the new Undersherrif and Catherine takes over Grissom's position in charge of the Night Shift. As mentioned previously, Grissom leaves with little fanfair and no cake in the breakroom

## Review

Sara appears at the end of the episode. After Grissom has left the lab he travels to Costa Rica where he uses a GPS to find Sara at a camp, working in the rainforest, taking pictures of a monkey. Hearing a sound, Sara turns and is surprised to find Grissom. They say nothing. Grissom drops his pack to embrace and kiss Sara.
