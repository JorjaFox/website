## Synopsis

A woman is found dead in a tour bus, after a night with a band, and another woman named Tangerine is missing. The driver of the bus is found, but no one actually knows the name of the band (they paid for the bus in cash) or how to get a hold of them. When a signature on the dead woman's breast is ID'd as Gene Simmons, he's brought in and explains the event was fake. It was part of a rock & roll package you can buy from 'The Fame Experience' Marty, the owner, confirms the dead woman is Marcy Cody, but swears he didn't hire Tangerine. The mystery gets deeper when the drummer of the pseudo band, Lex Young, is found dead, with a hand written song by him, dedicated to Tangerine.

Tangerine (real name Angela Glenn) turns out to be Lex's daughter. The killer was another member of Lex's band, jealous of Lex's success.

## Review

Sara is first on the scene, taking photos of the dead woman when D.B. Russell arrives. She and Nick investigate the owner of the fantasy camp (Marty Kirch, played by "Food for the Heart" alum Michael DesBarres).

## Notes

## Quotes
