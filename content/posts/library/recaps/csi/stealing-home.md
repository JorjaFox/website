## Synopsis

Dwayne Hicks calls the police when his wife, Debbie, and house are missing. He went to work that night and his wife was in his house, but now they're both gone. Dwayne, his brother Jimmy, and their sister Marla all argue over who might have stolen the house. The house is found in the hills, with Dennis Hutchings, a construction worker, dead underneath. Marla asked Dennis to steal the house for her so her family would stop fighting after their mother, Lois, died in the house (termite riddled beams dropped a flowerpot on her head).

Meanwhile, the dead body was run of Fred Blanchard, ex-boyfriend of the deceased Hicks mother, and he was stabbed and killed in the stolen house. When the house was driven to the hills, Fred slid out the door and was run over multiple times. The knife was left in his chest and fell out while on the road.

When the house is searched for Fred's murder weapon, a skeleton is found in the walls with papers. DNA confirms the body is Tony Perella, the father of Marla, but not Jimmy and Dwayne. The print on the knife that killed Fred matches Walter Hicks, who had been in prison for assault. He came back and killed Fred, just as he'd killed Tony for sleeping with Lois.

## Review

Sara and Nick talk about Nick's dating life as they come to the crime scene. When Sara goes back to the lab, she officially meets Finn. Back at the house, when the Hicks' siblings argue, Sara leans on the horn till they shut up.

In the end, the siblings fight again over the house and Finn threatens to take a chainsaw to it, until Sara points out that whomever owns the house will pay the bills for the damage caused when it was hauled into the hills.

## Notes

* Sara claims to be an only child, which contradicts season 3.
* Sara is the voice of reason when Finn is a madwoman with a chainsaw.
