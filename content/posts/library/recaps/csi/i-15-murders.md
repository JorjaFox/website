## Synopsis

Grissom, Catherine and Nick investigate a woman who is kidnapped from a grocery store, and her disappearance points to a serial murderer. Sara and Warrick work on an apparent burglary gone wrong that may be more than it seems.

_Note: This episode was originally filmed to air third (after "Cool Change" and before "Crate 'n Burial"), explaining Sara's attitude towards Warrick.

## Review

Sara works the apartment murder by herself until Warrick is assigned to help her -- something she is not happy about. She confronts Grissom, but doesn't get an answer that satisfies her. She rides Warrick the entire episode with an antagonistic attitude -- and then at the end she discovers that he was in the casino to collect a debt, not to gamble.

## Notes

* Sara still doesn't like Warrick because of his gambling, but she grudgingly works with him.
* Once Warrick explains what he was doing, Sara doesn't defend herself -- Grissom asked her to investigate Warrick.
* Sara's first use of power tools (her 'type A' personality).
* Sara takes a harsh tone with a suspect.
* Sara can differentiate between Warrick's personal life and his professional life.

## Quotes

**Grissom:** Sara. 419.
**Sara:** Dead body -- bonus.
**Catherine:** Whoa, somebody likes their job.

- - -

**Grissom:** Nick [...] 416 [...] She says she knows you.
**Catherine:** Former girlfriend?
**Nick:** That depends. Is she the assaulter or the assaulted?
**Sara:** You tell us -- you like leather or lace?
**Nick:** _(laughs)_ I'm not going to answer that _(turns to leave)_ Lace.

- - -

**Sara:** There's nothing benign about two $20s screaming, 'take me' on the bar.

- - -

**Sara:** I'm going to need you to strip.
**Kenny** What, right here?
**Sara:** Don't be shy on my account. But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom. Oh, and I'm going to need to take your window with me. It's all in the warrant.

- - -

**Sara:** Grissom reinstated you.
**Warrick:** And you have a problem with that.
**Sara:** Let me guess. Grissom gets you to dime yourself off and now you both feel better? You're supposed to be in court. Instead, you're placing bets for a cheap thrill to satisfy nothing.
**Warrick:** Hey! This has nothing to do with you. So are we going to work together, or not?
**Sara:** I'm already working.

- - -

**Sara:** I'm surprised you didn't tag him as a fellow gambler.
**Warrick:** You just don't let up.
**Sara:** _(keeping her back turned to Brown)_ It's a flaw.

- - -

**Warrick:** Oh, so now I'm worthy?
**Sara:** Just take a damn look.

- - -

**Warrick:** Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?
**Sara:** I never said you weren't a good CSI.
