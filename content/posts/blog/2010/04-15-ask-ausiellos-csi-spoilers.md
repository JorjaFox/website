The number one question I've been asked lately is "Is Jorja coming back to _CSI_ next season?"  And I don't know. I can't know! Wanna know why?  _CSI_ doesn't even know!  Seriously.  It makes it hard for even a super-spy to find an answer to a question that's not been asked yet.

If you don't believe me, well, Ausiello (I know, I know) confirms:

> **Question: I would ask if you knew if Jorja Fox was going to re-sign with _CSI_, but the chances of getting an answer are slim to none, right? – ALS**
>
> **Ausiello:** Slim to none... yes and no. I have an answer for you, but it’s sorta “nebulous.” “Jorja and I haven’t sat down and talked about next season,” E.P. Carol Mendelsohn tells me. “But [she's] definitely in the finale, and since the finale is a ‘to be continued,’ I would say it’s a pretty good bet that Jorja will be back for at least some or all of next season. It’s been great having her with us this season.”

So there we go.  We probably get he for some next season, but no one knows.  We'll probably find out for sure in June ... when I go camping.

Next, I know it's not about Jorja or Sara, but this has been a hot topic all over the _CSI_ fandom.  Is Catherine going to die?  Again, I turn to that troublemaker, Ausiello:

> **Question: A rumor has been circulating about the _CSI _season finale regarding Catherine Willows’ fate. Any scoop on that? —Ann**
>
> **Ausiello:** There will be blood, and according to Carol Mendelsohn, it will belong to “more than one CSI.”</blockquote>
