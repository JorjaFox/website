While Jorja's in DC for the ADI Wine Dinner, she's actually there to support a new federal bill to end the use of wild animals in traveling circuses in the US: [TEAPSPA](https://www.stopcircussuffering.com/get-involved/usa-get-involved/support-teapspa/)

On March 28, 2017, Representative Ryan Costello (R-PA) and Representative Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) will reintroduce The Traveling Exotic Animal and Public Safety Protection Act (TEAPSPA), to amend the Animal Welfare Act to restrict the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses and traveling performances.

She and Eric and other stars spoke up at the event (the video has been removed).

There's a [transcript available](https://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/2017/reluctant-entertainers/) as well.

I've already called my senators.
