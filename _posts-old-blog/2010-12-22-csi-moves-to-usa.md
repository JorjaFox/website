So I don't know how I missed this, but _CSI_ is moving... On cable that is.

Starting January, SpikeTV has lost the exclusive rights to re-air the show, and it will now be on USA. They'll kick it off with 24 hours of _CSI_ on Friday, January 14th, 2011. Which means there's a great way to make your still hung-over friends puke. The extra fun zoom in camera feature! From now until 2014, both Spike and USAwill air the show.
