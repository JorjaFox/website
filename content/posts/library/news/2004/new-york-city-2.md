"It's like if you have a large rock fall on your head ... you absolutely don't want another rock to fall on you!"

That's "CSI" actress Jorja Fox, talking tentatively for the first time about the shocking firing of her and co-star George Eads, and then the equally startling turnaround when CBS rehired them. "CSI," a gritty, graphic forensic drama, is TV's top-rated series and has spawned a successful spinoff, "CSI: Miami." (Hollywood monolith Jerry Bruckheimer is the "CSI" producing power.) Fox and Eads have been with the show since it began. Money was at the heart of the matter, so the rumors went, when the actors supposedly didn't show up for work. Eads, who starred in TNT's "Evel Knievel" last week, has insisted that he overslept. Fox, who says she is "still in shock" from the professional push- pull, says the issue was not cash-related:

"I can say that it absolutely wasn't over money. But I can also say it is still something of a mystery to me. I mean, I don't act for money. That's not where I live, so to speak. I've done other things, had other jobs, where it was about money and putting a roof over my head and eating, but I don't put a price on my acting. Although naturally I think everybody's entitled to a raise when that time comes." (Fans know Jorja from the film "Memento" and from her original exposure in "ER.")

So why does she think she was fired? Fox, who emphasizes that she is "elated" to be back at work, replies carefully: "Well, it was over this letter that we were all asked to sign about reporting to work, and I'd really never seen such a letter in my life - my professional life - and I think they didn't like my response ... I just don't think the punishment fit the 'crime.' No threats were being made, nobody was asking for the sun, moon and stars ... and then, just as suddenly, CBS offered an olive branch. I really see this as a misunderstanding."

It is clear the actress doesn't want to get too specific (that first rock was a stunner) and her voice betrays considerable emotion and controlled indignation. It is humiliating to be fired, but she wants to put it behind her; there'll be no prolonged autopsy on this event. She adds with rueful amusement, "I have no foresight. You know when I got 'CSI,' I thought, 'What a great show; nobody'll watch this!'"

Still and all, we had to ask: Did she get a raise? "To CBS' credit, they did offer me more money. But I turned it down." Why? "For one thing, George's head was still on the block - it would have looked like I was dancing on his misfortune. And, again, that's not what it was about."

On to happier subjects. Jorja's theater company,

Honeypot Productions, has a well-reviewed musical running in L.A., "Dear Bernard." She describes it with such enthusiasm, we suggest, "Why don't you film it, put it on TV?"

"That's an interesting idea," she says.

"Get CBS to do it. After all, if you didn't get a raise, you should get something."

The actress laughs, "Oh, I don't know about that. Remember, they offered the olive branch. Not the whole tree!"
