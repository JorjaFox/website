And says former U.S. Surf Champion Jericho Poppler Bartlow, "I remember thinking, \`Gidget could do it.I know I can.'"

"Accidental Icon: The Real Gidget Story," a new one-hour documentary, will world premier on October 8, 2006, at the Malibu Celebration of Film festival.

Narrated by Jorja Fox ("CSI") and produced by Brian L.
