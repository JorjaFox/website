Bret Stern, of Sono Studios and Bret Stern Productions, has announced that "Three Weeks to Daytona" is going to Sundace!

In a recent interview about the renovation of his studio, he publicly state:
<blockquote>Stern completed his own movie there, "Three Weeks to Daytona," with Rip Torn and Jorja Fox. "It's been submitted to Sundance and will make the festival circuit."</blockquote>

Here's hoping that those of us who aren't on the festival circuit will get a chance to pick up this on DVD!
