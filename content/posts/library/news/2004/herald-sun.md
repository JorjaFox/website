ACTOR Jorja Fox has been sacked from the hit TV drama CSI just a day before filming was due to begin on a new series.

It is thought she was fired after a dispute over her pay.

Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the drama, was five years into a seven-year contract with the CBS network. CSI is regularly Australia's most watched TV show.

Fox, 36, previously starred in ER as Dr Maggie Doyle and in a season of The West Wing as Gina Toscano.
