According to a [CBS Press Release](http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=19000), the premiere date was pushed back than the earlier suspected date.  Why?  Sources suggest it's related to expected presidential debates.  Better to air the first three or so CSI episodes together than air one, and take a week off.
