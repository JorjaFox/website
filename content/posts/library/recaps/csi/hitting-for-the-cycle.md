## Synopsis

Henry notices that the Graveyard shift is one natural death away from 'cycle' -- a homicide, a suicide, an accidental and a natural death all in one night. Nick, Hodges and Greg all begin betting on who will close out the cycle, Nick or Greg.

Greg's death is a woman who died of a ruptured, puss filled intestine, due to swallowing a paperclip which perforated her. Her death declared an accident, Greg and Sara go to a 419 where a gamer named Stevie (DV8Avenger) is found dead on his couch. He is morbidly obese and wears a diaper, but died of violent regurgitation. He had asphyxiated on his own vomit, caused by an epileptic seizure. At first they thought it was from the video game, but tox indicated he was asleep at the time of death, via sleeping pills prescribed to Evan Ferrari (his girlfriend) but slipped to DV8 by the DJ/host of the gamer super bowl. The DJ also slipped him an emetic (jealous because Evan was her ex girlfriend) and the combination killed him.

Nick and Ray get Benjamin Fowler, house sitting, found dead and tied up in the pool. It appears to be a robbery/homicide at first, but Fowler was shot by a small caliber bullet (in the back of the head) and is still wearing his wedding ring, even after a divorce. His ex still cared for him, but couldn't deal with his drinking and gambling anymore. The bullet is traced back to a loan shark, but Fowler killed himself in order to get his wife money to make up for being a terrible husband.

Meanwhile, Doc Robbins has a new assistant, Kevin, from LA, who is egotistic and misogynistic. And who dies of natural causes at the end of the night. Doc Robbins bet on David, who found the body, and won the bet.

## Review

Sara works with Greg on his cases, first the office worker, then the gamer. Sara is aware of the gambling going on for the cycle, but seems to have no interest in joining it. Others seem to be betting on her to win, though.

## Notes

* Sara is offended at Kevin's misogynistic ways.
* Sara got flowers from a dayshift guy, wishing _her_ luck on the cycle.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Someone from the dayshift sent me flowers.
**Greg:** Does he know you're married?
