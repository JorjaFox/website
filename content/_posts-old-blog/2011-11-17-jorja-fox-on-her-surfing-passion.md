The video is not embed-able (alas), but everyone should be able to see it at <a href="http://www.apimages.com/OneUp.aspx?st=k&amp;kw=Jorja%20Fox&amp;showact=results&amp;sort=date&amp;intv=None&amp;sh=6&amp;kwstyle=or&amp;adte=1321569685&amp;pagez=60&amp;cfasstyle=AND&amp;rids=c41a63e38c77462fbaf50f2a8e1d2e8a&amp;dbm=VThirtyDay&amp;page=1&amp;xslt=1&amp;mediatype=Video">apimages</a> and if not, how about a transcript?
<blockquote>I feel like I'm still learning to surf, you know? And that's one of the things that I think makes it so fun, because it's not really -- because I don't do it competitively, I never feel like I've stopped learning. For me, it can lower my ambition, to go out and surf for a few hours, is so fulfilling and seems almost like an education. And you feel kind of completely at peace afterwards. I did notice how as my goal got smaller as I started surfing, my ambitions got smaller as I started surfing. But I don't know if that's a bad thing!

[Break]

Probably the most recent amazing thing that happened -- I was out with a friend of mine, at a beach that we go to often. We have a pretty long whale season in California, and as we were paddling out, there was a whale making her way north, back towards Alaska. To be on a surfboard and to see that is almost hard to put into words.</blockquote>
