During an earlier era on television, teens hung out at the malt shop or the burger joint. But today their meeting place is the mall - and many of them work there.

What better place to set an earnest new miniseries aimed at teen viewers?

"Summer Stories: The Mall," a three-part edition of the "ABC Afterschool Special," premieres at 4 p.m. today (on Channel 13), with additional segments scheduled for the same time April 2 and 16 . The network calls it the first miniseries designed for this viewing period.

Like the Nanuet Mall of Rockland County, N.Y., where it was primarily filmed, "Summer Stories" has a scrubbed feeling, a vague artificiality. It falls somewhat short of conveying the grittiness of teen reality, particularly in language.
