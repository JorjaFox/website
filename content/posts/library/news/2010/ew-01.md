This just in: Jorja Fox (Sara) has renewed her commitment to *CSI*.

Sources confirm to me exclusively that Fox has signed on to return for the procedural’s upcoming 11th season. Terms of her new contract are being kept under wraps, so it’s unclear whether she’ll be billed as a recurring guest star or a series regular.

CBS declined to comment.

Fox was one of five *CSI* vets negotiating new pacts with the show -- and the last to sign on the dotted line. She joins fellow returnees Marg Helgenberger (Catherine), George Eads (Nick), Eric Szmanda (Greg), and Paul Guilfoyle (Jim). Laurence Fishburne (Ray) reupped last April for one more year. Liz Vassey, meanwhile, will not be back.

Thoughts? Happy? Sad? Too focused on the weekend to care? Hit the comments!
