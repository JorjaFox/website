The L.A. Zoo's plans for an Elephant Forest are on hold, thanks to activists like Lily Tomlin and <strong>Jorja Fox</strong>.  At the meeting in City Hally, Fox, Tomlin and others spoke up as to how the new exhibit will do little, if anything, to prevent the foot and leg injuries found in elephants in captivity, and questioned as to whether zoos should have any animals in captivity at all.  Instead, they support animal sanctuaries.
