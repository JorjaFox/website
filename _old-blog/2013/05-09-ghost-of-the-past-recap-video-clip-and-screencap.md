That was sufficiently creepy to me. Interesting call backs to older episodes, and not as much Brass as I'd have liked to see on a case he worked twenty years ago. Then again, he's heavy in next week. I don't like knowing Sara's going to miss the finale for this Lyle Brinks case in San Francisco, but I get the feeling that the cliffhanger next week is going to involve this somehow. I mean, that's more setup for a missed episode than normal, isn't it? Maybe this is Sara's ghost of her past...

By the way, in "Burden of Proof," Sara told Grissom she'd been a vegetarian since the pig experiment in "Sex, Lies and Larvae." The claim that it was a 'slaughterhouse' that made her stop eating meat is contradictory, unless she only meant to tell Grissom he was cheerfully re-affirming her meatless life.
