While anyone can comment on the blog posts, only registered users can post on the groups.  Simple, right?  Except that once you register for an account, you can no longer post <em>without</em> logging in on the blog posts!  See, the whole site is interconnected, and in order to make sure impostors don't pretend to be you, I updated a bit of code called 'Impostercide' to tell you 'Hey, that user ID, email or URL is the same as someone who registered here.  Please log in!'

Now there's a small 'bug' with that, in that some people have the same domain, but most of the time this works just fine.

Basically it's this: Once you make an account, you <strong>must</strong> log in to post anything. No more anonymous for you!
