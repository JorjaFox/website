February 3rd is "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" and if you're not amped for that, boy are you on the wrong site!
<blockquote>"The Two Mrs. Grissoms" - A night full of celebration ends with a bang when the director of a scholarship foundation for the deaf is killed by a deadly car bomb, prompting Sara to interrogate the students and faculty of the college where her mother-in-law works, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, Feb. 3 (9:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.  Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin ("Children of a Lesser God," "The L Word") guest stars as a deaf professor and Grissom's ex-girlfriend, Julia Holden.  Phyllis Frelich ("Santa Barbara") guest stars as Grissom's deaf mother/Sara's mother-in-law.</blockquote>

February 10th is episode #14, "All That Cremains" which does have Jorja in it (and Katee Sackhoff!):
<blockquote>"All That Cremains" -- A thrift store donation turns gruesome when a dead body is found in a box; meanwhile, Langston's wife pays a surprise visit to the crime lab, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION. Singer Christiana Millian ("Pulse") guest stars as the victim's ex-girlfriend, Sydney. Tracee Ellis Ross ("Girlfriends") guest stars as Langston's wife, Gloria Parkes. Hip-hop artist Yelawolf makes a cameo appearance.</blockquote>

On February 17th, Bieber comes back (sorry) for episode #15, "Targets of Obsession", along with Nate Haskell, but I don't know about Jorja (I think not, personally):
<blockquote>"Targets of Obsession" -- Langston testifies against the notorious "Dick & Jane" killer, Nate Haskell. Meanwhile, Nick receives a call from troubled teen Jason McCann to warn him of impending danger, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, Feb 17. Bill Irwin ("Rachel Getting Married") returns as Nate Haskell. Justin Bieber returns as Jason McCann, the brother of Alex McCann who Nick shot in the season premiere.</blockquote>

I don't know about Jorja's appearances in the next few episodes yet.  That said, do remember that there is CSI Watch, a handy email list for you to get notified ASAP when we know about what episodes Jorja will be in. I try not to spam.

But next year... <a href="http://www.tvline.com/2011/01/renewal-scorecard-whats-coming-back-whats-getting-axed-whats-on-the-bubble/">TV Line says it's a sure thing</a>.  Jorja?  Not a clue.
