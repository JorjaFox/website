Bexar (say it 'Bear' just like you do for Bexar, Texas, and carry on) looks so utterly put upon for this photo, but totally fuzzy and loveable. You can see more photos on <a href="http://shelterpetproject.tumblr.com/post/95783490415/csis-jorja-fox-shows-her-shelterpetlove-with-her">The Shelter Pet's Tumbler</a> or on the JFO Gallery under the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/animals/20140825-shelterpet/">Shelter Pet Project Emmy Gallery</a>.

<a href="http://www.theshelterpetproject.org/">The Shelter Pet Project</a> is working to make sure all animals have a safe and loving home. My cats are both rescues, and most of our animals tend to be. They're the ones a little harder to love sometimes, but I love 'em to peices.
