<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/mustangs.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/mustangs-100x100.jpg" alt="mustangs" title="mustangs" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2143" /></a> She hates what circuses do to animals, she stands up for poor Billy the Elephant, she hosts events for the Humane Society, and she thinks our treatment of animals is what defines us as a humane group of people. So really it shouldn't surprise anyone that <a href="http://www.harnesslink.com/www/Article.cgi?ID=77129">Jorja's also against the rounding up of wild horses</a>.

Just this month, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced that the Calico Complex round-up of over 2,700 wild horses will proceed on December 28 as planned, which is in seemingly direct opposition to the 1971 Wild Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act, which they're tasked with enforcing.

To a lot of urban Americans (and non-Americans) this needs some explanation.  Mustangs are a breed of feral horses (often also called wild horses) who roam the United States and Canada.  In the US, they're protected by law, but as with so many wild animals these days, their territory and number have dwindled greatly.  A few hundred can be found in Canada (Alberta and BC), but the majority are in the United States.  Right now, the BLM feels that a total of 27,000 mustangs is a "manageable" number.  The problem?  There are about 33,000 in the US alone.

The Calico Mountain Complex is in Nevada, where roughly half the mustangs in the US live. The BLM's plan will reduce the number of feral horses to something more 'manageable', by putting many in holding facilities or selling them for slaughter.

Humanity is, in my opinion, proved when we do something for those who cannot stand up and speak for themselves.

**What can you do?**

Contact your **US representative** and **<a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">senators</a>** that they should support a moratorium to stop the gathers, the roundups and removals pending Congressional action on the future management of the wild horses and burros.   Ask them to hold a hearing on the course of the wild horses and burros program.

Contact BLM Director Bob Abbey and ask him to stop: Robert_Abbey@blm.gov

The Animal Law Coalition has a lot more information that can help you decide if this is something you should support and how to do so.

It's not too late to save the mustangs.
