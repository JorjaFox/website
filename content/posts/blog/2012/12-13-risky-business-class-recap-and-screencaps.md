GSR is fine. For now.

Look. She didn't answer Grissom. There are a lot of reasons for that, and one is the very simple one that I happen to use now and then. "I am in a mood, and if I talk to Grissom, I will get in the biggest fight known to man. I need to process this without him, and call him when I can at least communicate and not rant." And she didn't go out with Doug. That hug at the end was a picture perfect example of someone who misses the one she loves, and is conflicted. In a way, it reminded me of "Leave Out All The Rest."

No, I don't think Grissom and Heather had sex in that episode, but I do think he really needed a friend, and was very lonely. So is Sara, and she found some comfort in Doug, as well as questions. Why does she feel like this? Can it be fixed? What now?

If you had any doubts, this is five stars for Sara. And for Jorja, who was just awesome.

And that's it. No more CSI until 2013. Unless the world ends.
