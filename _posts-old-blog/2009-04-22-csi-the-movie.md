This is not a joke.  William Petersen was quoted in the Radio Times as confirming there is interest in a CSI movie.  And guess who would be in it?  I'll let him tell you.

<blockquote>Not only is Petersen an executive producer of the hit series, but he's also busy planning a way to bring the bug-loving CSI boss back next year with a European adventure. And for the first time he has confirmed there will be a CSI film.

[...]But even more pressing is his plan to bring Grissom back next season in a two-part television story set in France.

"We have an idea for how it would happen - now Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) and I are out of the show, we could pull something off in Europe without disrupting the other episodes they have to shoot."</blockquote>

Sound off, JFO Nation. Would you like to see Sara and Gil in Europe?
