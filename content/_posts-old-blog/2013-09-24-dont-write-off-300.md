I know a lot of you are grumbling about GSR, or that we don't get a lot of resolution of San Francisco from last season (you can read <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/09/advance-review-csi-crime-scene-investigation-the-devil-and-db-russell/">CSI Files' Advanced Screening Review of "The Devil and D.B. Russell"</a> for more), but what if I told you episode 300 was Sara Centric?

Here's the latest from CSI Files:
<blockquote><em>CSI</em>‘s 300th episode, “Frame by Frame,” will air October 23. Described as a “Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**)-centric episode, the installment “deals with a cold case that got away from her that we did not see when she first joined the lab,” another source elaborates. The hour marks the return of original cast member **Marg Helgenberger**, last seen in Season Twelve. Helgenberger participated in one day of filming for scenes that will be used in “flashbacks.” “There’s a lot of cool Easter eggs from the show’s history,” the source continues. And while **William Petersen** will not make a cameo in the hour, “his presence is definitely felt by the end of the hour.” Just don’t expect that presence to be some inkling of a GSR reunion: “Sara’s struggles we will touch base with, but we’re not sure where that’s going to go. Hopefully that will come to a satisfying resolution, but she’s still struggling.”

Now I'm a little excited!

Oh and George is expected to be back after 6 eps or so.
