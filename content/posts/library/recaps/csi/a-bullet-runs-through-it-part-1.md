## Synopsis

In a two-part case that highlights the possible ways for a community to be divided over a shooting, the CSIs find themselves in the unenviable position of having to be neutral parties between the police and the citizens they protect.

A routine traffic stop is interrupted by a high speed car chase, and Sofia Curtis and Jim Brass join the uniforms in the pursuit. The criminals are armed with automatic rifles and nine-millimeters, and are firing on the police vehicles from the start. The cops give chase for 20 blocks, one car taking 78 bullets, before the chase went to foot. The rookie cop was shot and killed, and the others take little mercy in hunting down the four criminals. Three are shot and eventually die, while one gets away, shooting a teenager to take his bike.

The CSIs arrive and split up the scenes. Catherine takes Brass and Sofia's guns, and stays with them for their interview and processing. Grissom and Warrick take the alleys. Nick and Sara take the cars. Greg takes the 20 blocks of chase scene.

Brass gives a fairly clear recount of what happened, staying calm and as coherent as he can. Sofia, on the other hand, is scattered, distracted, and obviously discombobulated. Her story is choppy and she can not clearly remember the entire situation.

Nick, who speaks fluent Spanish, is surprised when the locals claim the criminals were shot in the back. Sara, who speaks no Spanish, processes a house shot in the crossfire, and is accosted by a woman who wants to know why this happened near her children. The entire community seems more in arms about the cops treatment of the criminals and the shot (and eventually dead) teenager, than the facts that a police officer is also dead and the criminals had long rap sheets. The mother of one of the dead criminals shouts at Warrick, and her other son punches him, though charges are not pressed.

While all this rankles the police, the evidence does not lie, and matters will only get worse as it appears the dead cop was shot by friendly fire.

## Review

Seen primarily in the scene with the Spanish speaking mother, Sara is obviously shaken and uneasy when asked to explain how something like this could happen. She has no answer when the daughter translates, asking why someone shot their house. No translation is needed when the mother cries and hugs her children, wanting answers that have no questions. While Sara continues to work on the case, she obviously takes the question hard.

## Notes

* Sara doesn't speak Spanish
