Yes, the US President, George Bush, will be giving his farewell address on Thursday, during primetime.  The speech is expected to run about 15 minutes.  What does that mean for _CSI_? Probably some last second swearing and scrambling.  The White House has requested airtime, but nothing definitive has been set as of this posting. I will update this post if I hear more.

**Update**: Bush wants to speak at 8pm ET (7pm CT). _(Jan-12 6pm) _
**Update #2**: CBS will air this at 8pm ET.  No word on what that'll do to CSI. _(Jan-13 8am) _
**Update #3**: Still no word on CBS's scheduling. _(Jan-13 3pm) _
**Update #4**: CBS is shifting everything back by at least 15 minutes. See the Press Release for details. _Jan-13 6pm_
