She's been on three hit TV series in as many years - *ER*, *The West Wing* and *CSI* - so you can't say Jorja Fox doesn't know how to pick choice roles. But while the natures of her shows have been diverse, the characters she's played have all had at least one thing in common: they are strong, independent women. On *ER*, Fox played cranky medical intern Maggie Doyle, on *The West Wing* she played the recurring role of Secret Service agent Gina Toscano. Now, on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*, Fox is the new kid on the block as Sara Sidle, a crime-scene analyst who seems about as unfazed as Agent Scully while picking through blood and guts. As gross as that sounds, we have to admit there's something sexy about a woman who can stomach the tough stuff ... and knows how to back a winner.
