Actress Jorja Fox, of the popular TV show CSI, undertook the work of compassion when she joined ADI in support of our landmark "Operation Lion Ark," to airlift 25 ex-circus lions from Bolivia to a new home in the US.

After our dangerous undercover investigations and public and political campaigns to get all animals out of circus throughout Bolivia, Jorja came on board and embraced ADI's cause to end animal suffering, and has inspired others to do likewise. She was there when we undertook to fly 25 lions from a terrible circus life in Bolivia to a spacious new home in a US sanctuary.

The lions, who lived as many as 8 in a cage the size of a double bed, now have 80 acres of land on which to roam, a top quality diet, and exceptional veterinary care. ADI's campaign to end circus suffering in Bolivia, and the rescue and continued care of the lions we saved has all been supported by Jorja and her fans!

Says Jorja, "I hope you'll join me in supporting Operation Lion Ark. These majestic animals have been through so much and now through the compelling and daring acts of ADI, they are finally going to have a life of ease, dignity, and grace. We'd love for you to be a part of this amazing and unprecedented epic event."

Visitors to two of Jorja's fan sites, **jorjaallaround.org** and **jorjafox.net**, felt the same way!

They combined efforts to raise money for Operation Lion Ark -- a generous $600! And both sites have further encouraged the adoption of the lions as a way to both bring in funding for their continued care, and to establish a positive bond between ADI supporters and these amazing creatures who care about giving these lions a wonderful future.

If you'd like to adopt a Lion Ark lion, either in support of Jorja Fox on her fan sites, or simply by contacting ADI, we'll be happy to set you up with "a lion of your own" complete with an adoption certificate featuring a drawing of your lion, along with our **[Animal Defender](https://www.ad-international.org/publications/go.php?id=2006)** magazine.

You'll get periodic updates about your lion, plus our special Animal Adopters magazine, "Toto News," three times a year. Animal Adoptions make great gifts too -- for the animal lover in your life, or just for yourself.

ADI wishes to thank everyone who has donated to help support our work to protect and save animals. Operation Lion Ark has meant a wonderful new life for all the lucky Bolivian ex-circus lions, but for animals the world over, it means HOPE!
