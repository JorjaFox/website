## Synopsis

Warrick, Catherine, and Nick try to determine the cause of a house fire that kills a teenage kill. The fire is in the same neighborhood as a similar arson fire. Grissom and Sara investigate a man found dead with letter tiles in his stomach. The man was a competitor in a word game tournament.

## Review

Sara and Grissom investigate the death of a man in a hotel bathroom, which leads them to a Logos tournament taking place there. She and Grissom interview the various players, and later she 'decodes' the victim's notes on the match.

## Notes

* Sara again displays her prowess with codes and puzzles when she helps Grissom with the letter tiles.
* Sara once again shows her phobia of germs in public places when she comments on the empty soap dispenser in the bathroom.
* Sara's lightning fast math skills are once again highlighted as she figures out the various score permutations from the victim's match.

## Quotes

**Grissom:** Good. What's an 'exvin'?\
**Sara:** I was actually hoping you'd know. It's not in the OED.
