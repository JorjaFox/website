<blockquote>> Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) in _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_. Why, oh why, must it be Sara? Office romance is inevitable sometimes and their relationship was hinted at early on in the series.

Understandably, working closely together at the crime lab and crime scenes leave little time for both Sara and Grissom to do any socialising. Plus, they share the same interests – bugs, blood, logic. But still, them being together is an uncomfortable notion.

The are-they or are-they-not theories were put to rest when at the end of season six, Grissom and Sara were shown lying on a bed together ... erm, talking.

In all seriousness, this very successful franchise need not indulge on the personal lives of its characters too much because it’s a show that does well when it’s just about collecting evidence and getting the criminal. In spite of this unwelcome romance, the characters made the show what it is so it is quite sad that they are both out of the picture in the series’ current season.</blockquote>
