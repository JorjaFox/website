Remember we talked about <a title="Ranking the Cast of ER" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/ranking-the-cast-of-er/">Maggie Doyle on <em>ER</em> last week</a>? Let's look at <em>West Wing</em> this week! Jorja really has been on all the hit shows in the last 20 years, which is really wild.
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">As of this month, <em>The West Wing </em>is 15 years old. We'll pause as you absorb how long you've been without Jed Bartlet and his merry band in your life. Doesn't it feel like just yesterday we all fell in love with Aaron Sorkin's bastion of liberal idealism wrapped up in fast-paced dialogue usually said while walking?</p>
&nbsp;

[...]
<h3 dir="ltr">31. Gina Toscano</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11268" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/09/bedd61ea4.jpg" alt="Gina Toscano" width="238" height="250" />Played By:</strong> Jorja Fox
<strong>Number of Episodes:</strong> 5</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have been a lot of great Secret Service characters on The West Wing, but no one embodied Gina’s mix of robotic professionalism and sublimated heart that goes into being a bodyguard quite as well. She's always Zoey's chum, a bit of a big sister figure and a fearless soldier who would dive in front of gunfire for her. Toscano's arc ends at the assassination of the season one finale, but every subsequent Secret Service character felt like it was building off of her. – <i>DS</i></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Episodes: </strong>"What Kind of Day Has It Been?" is told, a little bit, through Gina's keen eyes as she spots the shooters, not quickly enough, who give us our first-season cliffhanger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">That moment, that shot of her screaming "GUN!" marked a major change in this site. All of the sudden, everyone wanted to know about this woman. And the next thing we all knew, she was on CSI (with a haircut) and solving crimes like a boss. I really loved Gina, her five episodes were a hoot, especially how she spent her breaks going over photos of skinheads. We never found out why she wore a wedding ring, but we knew she'd keep Zoey's secrets about boys safe from her father, even if dad was the President.</p>

<p dir="ltr">My favorite tidbit about that show? Jorja got run over by a car. When the shooter fires, she jumps to protect her charge. There's a limo that runs up to block the, and it ran right over Jorja's leg. She was fine, but they took her to the ER ... where everyone recognized her from <em>ER</em>.</p>
