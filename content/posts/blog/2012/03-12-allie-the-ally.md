I admit, I had no idea what [Allie the Ally](http://allietheally.tumblr.com/) was until about 3 minutes ago. The Allie the Ally project started at the James Hubert Blake High School Gay-Straight Alliance, Allies 4 Equality. They are sending around a doll named Allie to members and supporters of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LBGTQ) community to show support for LBGTQ youth.

And Allie visited CSI.
