This is geeky.  The short answer is I changed the backend of JFO, and you shouldn't notice anything weird (except in the forums, I know), but if you do, let me know.

So here's the silly thing.  I've actually been running multiple WP blogs to run the site and it drives me nuts. I should have done WPMU (multi-user, which really means multiple blogs, one install), but at the time, WPMU wasn't the greatest.  Anyway, as of a month ago, WP and WPMU have begun to merge to the point that it was testable. I ran a few tests and everything worked so well this morning, I thought ... why not.

NO DATA WAS LOST.

Seriously. I took backups, good ones, this time.  I'm 100% confident I can rollback if this all goes to hell and back.

If you have questions, or see something weird, let me know but <strong>before </strong>you do, try this:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cookies">Erase your browser cookies for jorjafox.net</a><br />If you don't remember your password, that's okay, you can ask the happy system for a password reset.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cache">Clear your browser's cache</a><br />This probably won't need to happen, but it's useful anyway.</li>
</ol>

Still got a problem?  Email me, comment here, tweet me, whatever. Put in the URL that has the problem (seriously, not 'the login screen', I want the URL so I can make sure you're going to the right place!) and if you think it'll help, a screenshot.
