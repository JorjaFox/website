It's official: Lauren Lee Smith is out on *CSI*, and Jorja Fox is back in! The prodigal star spoke exclusively to TVGuideMagazine.com about her return for at least five episodes.

**So what prompted your return to *CSI*?**
Right around March, I felt really rested and was itching to work--I was ready and going to meetings and auditioning. When I was in Atlanta [filming a guest shot on Lifetime's *Drop Dead Diva*], I got the call about *CSI*--it was completely out of the blue! I never thought I'd be going back to work with people that I knew, I thought I'd be starting new things. That was a surprise, so I'm going back to work and it's with the same people who I've worked with for eight years in the past. [Laughs] I was thrilled! For me it was a huge compliment!

**When do you begin filming?**
I was there all week--they started shooting July 20. I think I'm about knee-deep back in the water. It has just been a ball and a half. I think *CSI*'s premiere episode is one of the best that I've ever read. It's a pleasant surprise. You think, "They're starting Season 10--how is it going to be as good as it was last year or four years ago?" And they blew me away.

**Do you know yet what brings Sara back to Vegas?**
I think all I can really say is [pause] the team has had a rough year--there has been a lot going on--and so Sara comes back mostly just to see if she can help for a while, because she loves those guys and she misses them.

**And if Sara is back in the lab, where does that leave Gil?**
Ah! That will hopefully be a reveal in the premiere. They've prevented me from discussing Grissom at all. [Laughs]

**It's got to be the burning question for fans of the show... **
Thank you. We hope we've picked the right stuff to be a surprise.
