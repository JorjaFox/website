It's been just over two years since we switched from my hand-hewn theme to Theme Hybrid - News.  Now we're making a further step in DevPress, which means nothing except ... well it's easier for me to do things now!

Not everything is finalized yet, though I'm enjoying the red color right now so it'll probably stay.  The gallery and JorjaPedia are a very rough cut, and will be smoothed out over time.  The basics are here to stay though!  If you see something you totally love or hate, let me know!

Oh, and I know that the clickable smilies aren't working everywhere yet.  I'm on that.
