Just in time to enjoy a rainy drive up to LA tonight, we have the Paley Center's tribute to CSI.

I plan on being there. But for those who cannot, there is a livestream of the event! You can <a href="https://screen.yahoo.com/live/event/paleyfest-csi-farewell-salute">watch it on Yahoo.com</a> (that's a direct link) but I've embedded it here as well:

<iframe width='640' height='360' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' src='https://screen.yahoo.com/paleyfest-fall-tv-previews-csi-160000571.html?format=embed' allowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' allowtransparency='true'></iframe>

It does _not_ look like it has Closed Captioning (sorry). I will attempt to download it when I get home and do some transcription, provided it's downloadable. I'll take some photos while there, but personally I want to be able to enjoy the farewell.

Edit: If you need to translate this to your local time, please visit <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Paley+Center+CSI+Panel&iso=20150916T19&p1=137">Time and Date.com</a> where I set up an event for you to help sort it out.
