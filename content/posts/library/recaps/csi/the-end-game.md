## Synopsis

The CSI unit faces the final showdown with the Gig Harbor killer whose motives are finally revealed. Also, Nick makes a decision that will affect the entire team moving forward.

With Nick being courted by San Diego to lead up their lab, Finn gets a package from her mother that is actually from Paul Winthrop, the Gig Harbor Killer, last seen limping away from the fatal shooting of his brother, Jared Briscoe  can help. Larson, who did provide women for the boys, had nothing to do with the killings, and suspects Collin Winthrop, Paul's father, as the third partner to the killings.

David Hodges traces the ink in Winthrop's severed finger to a specific tattoo artist in Vegas. Winthrop has taken on the tattoos of his brother in order to become both of them. On the trail of Collin, Nick goes down to San Diego where they find him and Paul Winthrop's new base of operations. When Winthrop spots them, he kills his father and Shaw, who jumps between Finn and a bullet.

Brother Larson also talked to Collin Winthrop shortly before he died, contrary to what he claimed when questioned by Finn. Larson was also the father of the brothers. Mae was Collin's daughter and mother of the killers. She was also Sister Alice, the woman at the convent where the boys where born. Alice is on the run, however, and Winthrop attacks Finn, locking her in the trunk of a car with plans to dump her in the desert. D.B. Russell interrupts him, coming to pick up Finn and take her to Seattle to find Alice.

Winthrop is shot when the police burst in and Finn is left in critical condition. Finn remains in a coma as the episode ends while Winthrop will recover and pay for his crimes. Nick takes the job in San Diego.

## Review

Nick asks Sara if he should take the job in San Diego.

While Nick is in San Diego, Sara is left in charge of the lab as DB and Finn are headed to Seattle. She proves herself more than capable, reading the situation and sending out the CSIs to the right places at the right time.
