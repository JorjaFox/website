## Synopsis

Sara and Greg arrive on scene to find the dead 'Jack Smith' in a pool of blood, shot in the neck, in an apartment covered in blood. When they examine the body, Sara notices the victim's eyes were bleeding and calls the CDC. The two are quickly put in special suits and transported to a hospital as they may be infected. The evidence from the case is at risk, since the CDC generally destroys everything to prevent contamination.

The CDC, working with a lab called Rynelab, determines it is a virus, similar to ebola, and has an 80% fatality rate.

While Sara and Greg are in medical lockdown, Nick and Morgan go over the evidence they can (photos at first). They're able to ID the victim as Jack Weaver, a former viral researcher. The bullet casing is traced to Sean Stubbins, whom they find also infected by the virus. Sean saw someone in a CDC type suit and thought they were making meth, so he followed to rob them. When he saw Jack dying, he grabbed the briefcase and ran, but was startled by the man in the CDC plastic suit, so he shot at them and accidentally killed Jack.

Jack was obsessed with the virus and its outbreaks for years. Heather Lanning, who worked with Jack at Rynelab, let Jack in to visit. While there he stole a sample. The CSI uses microbial profile to prove that not Jack but Rudy, the lawyer, stole the sample and finds that Rynelab caused an outbreak in Bolivia years ago. Rudy admits he did this because Jack and Rynelab caused his entire family to die.

## Review

The whole episode is about Greg and Sara. Greg immediately starts to panic, but Sara reminds him that they've been through something similar before. As time goes by, Sara starts to worry that the previous day was the last normal day ever, and an epidemic has started. Greg suggests they stop putting off things they want to do and call his grandmother, but Sara looks thoughtful and sad about.

Sara develops a headache and fever, passing out (or rather falling down like a log and scaring the hell out of Greg). Sara asks Russell to let them help solve the case, so they can go out fighting and he agrees, but orders her not to die.

After the case is solved, Greg wakes up to see Sara's bed empty and stripped of sheets. As he panics, Sara walks in to tell him she's fine and so is he. The virus dies in the air after roughly two hours. They were never at risk.

## Notes
