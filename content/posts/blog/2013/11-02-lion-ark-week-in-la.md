_Lion Ark_Â is opening for a week long run in Los Angeles on November 15 to the 21st. You can get tickets from the venue at <a href="http://www.laemmle.com/theaters/4">Laemmle</a> directly.

In addition? There's a VIP screening at the Aidikoff Screening Room on Rodeo Drive, Friday the 15th, at 6:3pm. Tickets are $500.... let me quote:
<blockquote>Tickets are $500 and include a wonderful opportunity to hear about the rescue plans and enjoy a very special Hollywood Executive style screening with sparkling wine, vegan food and celebrity guests including Bob Barker, Jorja Fox, Kate Linder, Tonya Kay and Mindy Sterling.</blockquote>
So basically Jorja's just going to be running on fumes pushing for this, which is totally awesome. Tickets for that are on sale via the ADI, or just <a href="https://www.secure.adi-navs-ldf.org/donate.asp?id=1209&amp;cachefixer">click here</a> to pick them up. It's cocktail attire, mind you.
