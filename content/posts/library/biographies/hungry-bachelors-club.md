Jorja Fox (Delmar Youngblood) is the lead in THE HUNGRY BACHELORS CLUB, playing a single mother with an unusual offer that may make her dreams come true. She had a recurring role as Dr. Maggie Doyle on NBC's hit series ER. Her television credits also include guest leads on Law and Order and most recently, a pilot for Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, Flesh and Blood. While THE HUNGRY BACHELORS CLUB marks Fox's theatrical debut in a leading role, she is no stranger to film, having appeared in VELOCITY TRAP, ALCHEMY, HOW TO MAKE THE CRUELEST MONTH and TIARA TANGO, among others. Fox studied theatre and appeared onstage in New York and Los Angeles. She formed Honeypot Productions, a theatrical troupe in Los Angeles that presents one-act plays. Fox recently completed the feature MOMENTO, a dark suspense-mystery with Guy Pierce and Carrie Anne-Moss.
