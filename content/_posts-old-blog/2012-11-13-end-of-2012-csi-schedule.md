<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5733" title="Marina Del Ray (Fake Seattle)" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/11/A7N5kY0CQAAJ1-0-187x140.jpeg" alt="Marina Del Ray (Fake Seattle)" width="187" height="140" />Here's the schedule for the rest of the year:
<ul>
	<li>Ep 07 - Fallen Angel - Nov 14th</li>
	<li>Ep 08 - CSI on Fire - Nov 21st</li>
	<li>Ep 09 - Strip Maul - Nov 28th</li>
	<li>Ep 10 - Risky Business Class - Dec 12th</li>
</ul>
<del>I'm actually 90% comfortable putting Ep 10 as the on December episode, based on the previous seasons</del>, I was wrong! Liz Devine tweeted me to say it was Dec 12th! Which means if the popular theory about the Mayan calendar is right, the last CSI we get before we all die is a Sara heavy episode. And if the theory is, as I think, totally off base, then we end out the year with a Sara heavy episode. I think it's win-win, really.
