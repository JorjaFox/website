The JFO Gallery revamp is done! You shouldn't notice much by the way of changes, since I kept all the URLs the same, but if you find bad things happening, please let me know the URL that caused the problem and what you were trying to do (even if it's 'I went to the gallery and clicked on 'TV' link and it broke, I need to know what URL you ended up at!).

With 17,367 images sorted into 544 albums, it was surprisingly fast to move from <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com">Gallery2</a> to <a href="http://zenphoto.org">ZenPhoto</a>.  The reason why was complicated and simple (aren't they all?).

I've been using Gallery2 (aka G2) for the site ever since 2002, when we grew too big for my homemade script.  G2 is big, it takes up diskspace and memory, but it was meant for big usage. The problem is that we never quite grew into it, and even now, the G2 development has moved to G3 (Gallery3) which is a total rewrite. Yeah, the developers abandoned the old code and did a total rewrite.  As great as that was for the site, it meant I'd have to re-do my theme.  Once that was on the table, I decided I'd look into as many other options as possible. Logically, I made a list of my requirements and started testing.

Eventually I got around to testing G3, and I found that while I really like the direction in which it's heading, it's perfect for me personally, but not the JFO gallery.  Also, the new theme engine frustrated me to no end, and worst of all, I couldn't upload pictures behind a firewall (which would mean delays in images for you!) due to Flash.  I tried a few other tools, but I started to resign myself to being stuck on G2.

Quite by accident I ran into ZenPhoto. Another fansite was using it, and I figured I'd test it.  The authors use bbPress and WordPress (which I use here) and I thought odds were good for cross-compatibility.  Wednesday afternoon I started messing with it, and by Thursday I was done with the move.  That's how easy it was.

So here we are, on a whole new system for images.  And in theory, nothing's changed.
