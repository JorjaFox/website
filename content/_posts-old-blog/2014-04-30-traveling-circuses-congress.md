I tried to make that a shorter headline, but really that was it.
<blockquote>Today on Capitol Hill, U.S. Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA) introduced the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act to Congress, a bill to restrict the use of wild animals in traveling circuses.

The Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act (TEAPA) aims to end the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses, due to the unavoidable suffering caused by the very nature of the traveling show: small, mobile and temporary facilities, restriction of movement, barren environments and long, arduous journeys.

CSI actress Jorja Fox, known to 73 million viewers as CSI’s Sara Sidle, said: “Congress has a responsibility to protect the welfare of animals and ensure public safety. A prohibition on the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses is proportionate, responsible, the least expensive solution to this problem, and long overdue. We call on Congress to bring to an end, once and for all, the abuse and suffering that has been exposed by ADI time and time again.”

ADI also cite the growing popularity of shows with human performers like Cirque de Soliel, as an example of how circuses can adapt and eliminate wild animal acts and at the same time become more relevant to modern audiences.</blockquote>
