On November 15, 2000, I registered JorjaFox.net, bought the hosting, and brought us all here, to this very place.

Well, not this place.  We started on SimpleNet, moved to Yahoo, and then eventually to <a href="http://www.liquidweb.com/?RID=JFO123">LiquidWeb</a> (where we are today on a big ol' server!).  Last year, I put the date in my calendar, and it beeped at me today to remind me that this is the end of year 11 and the start of year 12.  I remember the reason I got the domain: _CSI_ had just gotten it's full season pickup.

That was a long time ago, and who knew then that today I'd be pulling off the curtain on a winter fundraiser!

This isn't a Christmas or any holiday fundraiser.  This is a 'Gee it's cold outside' fundraiser.  Technically, Winter starts in just over a month (December 22), so from today until February 15th, you can <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/adi-teapa/fundraiser/jorjafoxonline">donate to our ADI - TEAPA fundraiser</a>.  What's that?  Why ADI just made history with the unveiling of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act (TEAPA see?), H.R. 3359, the first-ever federal bid which aims to protect all wild and exotic animals forced to travel and perform in US circuses.

Jorja's in on it, and so are we.  Click the Crowdrise button below and donate, or just spread the word!

Animals deserve a better winter, after all.
