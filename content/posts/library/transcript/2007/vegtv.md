**Announcer:** VegTV on the road with Marie Oser.

**Marie Oser:** I'm here with Jorja Fox from "CSI", a long time vegetarian, vegan. I asked you once what was your epiphany; it was a meatball sub in Brooklyn. And that was great!

**Jorja Fox:** "\*laughing\*" I told that story a couple of days ago to a friend! "CSI" 's out here in force tonight, there's actually a little posse of us. There's a couple vegetarians that I work with and a couple of vegans. You know, when we can we've done, uh, three stories that I can think of right now that really kind of focus on animal welfare issues.

**Marie Oser:** We so appreciate everything you do for the animals.

**Jorja Fox:** Thank you so much! There are so many causes and people always have to follow their passion, you know, and if we're all doing that just a little bit, then the whole world's going to be better on every level, you know? For people and animals and the environment.

**Marie Oser:** What a great role model! I mean she's been a vegetarian most of her life!

**Jorja Fox:** If everybody just tried to cut down a little bit on these things, it would make a huge global impact very quickly. You'd be surprised. So, check it out.

**Marie Oser:** Cool. Check it out!
