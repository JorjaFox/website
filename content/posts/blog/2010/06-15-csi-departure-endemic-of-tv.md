In the summer of 2004, Jorja Fox and George Eads were fired from _CSI_ for (respectively) failing to agree not to stage a sick out and oversleeping.  Jorja remarked that she did too agree not to stage a sick out, but in sending her reply via registered mail, CBS decided it was 'late' and fired her.  She was shortly thereafter rehired, but without the raise every other cast member got.  She held out until George Eads was also re-hired, and he too suffered the no-raise punishment.  In CBS's defense, this came right on the heals of Brad Garrett (then the co-star of the popular _Everybody Loves Raymond_), staging a sick-out in order to get a raise.  And, yes, Jorja (and George, and everyone on _CSI_) had asked for a raise.

Jorja pointed out that asking for a raise, at contract negotiation time, is de rigur for television actors.  After she was re-hired, Jorja also did not sign the contract extension that would keep her on the show after season seven, which may have played into her decision to leave in season eight (2007).

This brings us back to today, where CBS has been playing ball with actors about re-signing onto their hit shows, like _NCIS_ (everyone but Sean Murray has finally signed back on, after some lengthy contract negotiations), _The Big Bang Theory_ (<a href="http://www.veronica-mars.tvsquad.com/2010/06/04/give-the-big-bang-theory-stars-a-raise-now/">where the actors are asking for a raise as a team</a>), _Two and a Half men_ (Charlie Sheen's litigation was the sticking point there, but also his $2 million per episode price) and now _Criminal Minds_.

Contract sagas have been on my mind since I heard about the _NCIS_ issues, but now this tidbit erally drives home the matter:
<blockquote>Heading to Season 6, CBS’ successful crime drama _Criminal Minds_ is trimming the female portion of its cast for what I hear are financial reasons. I'm told the option of series regular A.J. Cook has not been picked up and co-star Paget Brewster is being made an offer to stay for only a reduced number of episodes next season, leaving fan favorite Kristen Vangsness as the only remaining full-time female cast member.</blockquote>

Drew Magary, columnist for Deadspin.com, mentioned outright that <a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Criminal-Minds-Cutting-Loose-Female-Cast-Members--Isnt-That-Kinda-Wrong-96385974.html">"And Jorja Fox was fired “CSI” (then rehired before she left again) for asking for a raise."</a>.  It's not 100% accurate, but it's something that was long suspected now and then.

Drew goes on to point out:
<blockquote>Keep in mind all these female actresses on _“Criminal Minds”_ are being cut away for budget reasons while CBS happily renews Charlie Sheen’s _“Two And A Half Men”_ contract for $2 million an episode. Sheen, as you may know, was arrested earlier this year for allegedly threatening to kill his wife. He’s indispensable. Paget Brewster? Not so much.</blockquote>

It's not just CBS, too.  This has been going on for years.  When I was younger, I remember being crushed that Denise Crosby's character, Tasha Yar, was killed off from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, shortly after she objected to how her character was sidelined and asked for more screen time.  I used to have a comic taped to my wall "A woman asked for more screen time and she's dead", which had the rather popular female characters from SciFi shows depicted.  All of whom were killed off.  All after the actors asked for more money/screen time.

Is this sexism at work, simple cost-cutting measures, or something else?

I don't have the answer, but this is why I tell you "It's complicated" when you ask me about Jorja's contract.  It really is complicated.
