WHEN she announced that she was taking a break from acting three years ago, CSI fans flew planes over the Universal Studios film sets in California in protest.

But the banners they used, which read 'Keep Jorja Fox on CBS', can now be kept away.

That's because Jorja Fox, 42, will reprise her role as tough cookie forensic scientist Sarah Sidle on hit crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's 10th season.

Incidentally, she and CSI co-star George Eads were fired from the show in 2004 over a work dispute.

It was eventually resolved in over a week and the two were rehired by TV network CBS.

Returning to the series, Fox found that some things haven't changed. She told The New Paper in a phone interview from Los Angeles: 'What surprises me is that so much time has passed and yet what's still tough about filming CSI are the elements.

**'We can be working an entire week in the rain and the next, around fires. The violence (depicted in the murder cases) is also something that is hard to bear.**

'That is why I always watch Disney films, romantic comedies and take little trips so that I can stay away from that side of life.'

Given a choice, the sassy brunette with the signature gap between her front teeth would rather be on rival drama series Lost.

The New York native loves its science fiction theme.

Then there's the fact that Lost is shot in Hawaii, which appeals to the avid surfer in her.

'I remind my manager to call them (the Lost producers) every year to remind them that I want to be on their show.

'If I could, I would want to play one of The Others (the show's antagonists),' she said.

For now, the actress is happy to reunite with the CSI cast, who were 'too busy' to hang out with her when she was on her hiatus.

She said she was surprised and flattered when CSI's producers asked her to return to the series. It has been reported that her role has been extended indefinitely.

A big perk of playing Sidle, she said, is getting to chase bad guys, rappel down hillsides and rescue kids out of burning buildings.

And for someone who hasn't been to Asia, it was a real eye-opener when she got to watch a montage of dubbed CSI episodes that the series' international department had put together.

'It amazes me that the show is played in so many parts of the world like Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore.

'So I got to see myself speak in 20 different languages. I couldn't believe it. I can barely speak English,' Fox joked.

So what can we expect in the new season, which premieres over AXN (StarHub Ch 19) on 24 Feb at 10pm?

CSI's ninth season, which saw the former regular returning as a guest star for three episodes, ended with Sidle and love interest Gil Grissom (William Petersen, who has since left the show) sharing a passionate kiss in the jungle.

In Season 10, Sidle and Grissom are married and living in Paris.

**Lucky in love**

Fox had great praise for former co-star Petersen, whom she said was smart, funny and passionate.

She admitted that Sidle has been lucky in love on the series, having had paramedics and even coroner's assistants after her.

But if Sidle hadn't ended up with Grissom, who does Fox think would've been her other choice?

'People tend to think that Grissom is a little too old for Sarah and Greg Sanders (played by Eric Szmanda) is a little too young for her. But Greg has matured a lot, so Sarah would have chosen him.'

Hopefully, Fox is here to stay.

'If CSI were to ever end, what I would want to take from the hospital set are these '70s-looking paintings that are hung in the corridor.

'I would also take the metallic cabinets from the autopsy room and maybe a skeleton or two,' she said with a laugh.
