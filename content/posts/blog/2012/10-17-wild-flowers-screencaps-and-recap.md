Wow.

I do give it three stars for Sara, but that's an episode I _never_ want to watch again. It was way too heavy. I dreaded the watch-back and screencap. But this I do for you. The bit with 'Grissom' at the beginningwas in keeping with things, I feel, and was why this was a three star and not two.

Oh and here's the intro dialogue you may like.
<blockquote>**Grissom:** _[Voicemail]_ This is Gill Grissom. I'm unable to take your call, please leave a message.

**Sidle:** _[To her phone]_ Hello, Gilbert. Happy Anniversary. I hope you're out there celebrating. And it's official, time differences really suck. Look, I miss you. I'm going to try to call you back later. It's been a while, you know, since we really caught up. Love you.

**Russell:** _[To his phone]_ ... nah, I'm taking good care of myself. Matter of fact, I had leftover pizza for breakfast... I'm kidding honey! ... I know you're needed up there, but I need you down here, too... Love you too, sweatheart. Bye bye.

**Sidle:** Welcome to the joys of long distance relationships.

**Russell:** I don't know how you do it...</blockquote>
Neither do we, DB.
