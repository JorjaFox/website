<h3>CSI</h3>
A new Facebook game, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-crime-city-is-on-facebook/">CSI: Crime City</a> is in beta, so if you want to waste even more time on Facebook, go sign up!

We had some interesting changes when CBS flipped the airing of a couple episodes, and then press releases came out contradicting what we heard on set.  And then?  Photos released by CBS <em>contradicted</em> their own press release!  In the end, Jorja was **not** in <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x04-sqweegel/">Sqweegel</a> or <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/no-jorja-in-cold-blooded">Cold Blooded</a>.  We <em>will</em> see her in "Bump and Grind", the first week of November, however.

**CSI Episodes**
&bull; Oct 7th, "Blood Moon" | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Blood_Moon">Recap</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season11/bloodmoon/">Screencaps</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/csi-11x03-blood-moon">Video</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x03-blood-moon/">Discussion Post</a>
&bull; Oct 21st, "House of Hoarders" | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/House_of_Hoarders">Recap</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season11/hohoarders/">Screencaps</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x05-house-of-hoarders-video-clips/">Videos</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x05-house-of-hoarders-discussion-post//">Discussion Post</a>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>
Jorja was in the main article of ADI International's Summer 2010 magazine, about the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-in-adis-summer-2010-magazine/">rescue of the lions from Bolivia</a>.

Meanwhile, in a 2009 flashback, a picture of Jorja and Emily Deschanel surfaced from the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/a-night-for-the-whales-2009/">2009 A Night for the Whales Celebration</a>.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
News from the movie "Three Weeks to Daytona" finally cropped up.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/three-weeks-to-sundanc/">It's off to Sundance!</a> Huzzah!

Since we had no Jorja in "Sqweegel" I thought I'd fill in the time with some <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/filling-in-some-missing-persons/">Missing Persons</a>.  I recapped the two missing episodes and put up a video clip for you all.

Also, the idea of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/diastema-the-sex-symbol/">Diastema as a Sex Symbol</a> came up again. What do you think about Jorja's gap?

<h3>Community</h3>
After a hassle, a deleted account, and then a new one just for JFO, I've finally set up a Fan Page for JFO on Facebook. <a href="http://facebook.com/JFO.Fans">http://facebook.com/JFO.Fans</a> is there for you to follow ... JFO.  It's really mostly what gets posted here, but some people really like getting all this on Facebook, so there you are.

<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/10/10-18-2010-2-01-12-PM-fake.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/10/10-18-2010-2-01-12-PM-fake-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="10-18-2010 2-01-12 PM-fake" width="100" height="100" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2653" /></a> Speaking of delete accounts, the **fake** twitter account @JorjaFox <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/fake-jorja-fox-twitter-account-suspended/">has been suspended</a>. Of course, then a new one, @RealJorja, cropped up.  This is also a fake account.  The image on the right details my conversation with her and how I know she's a fake. I think it'll be pretty self explanatory to you guys.

I want to remind you to **not** attack these people! Don't harass them or bully them or anything other than block them.  Don't let them bring you down to their level.  I admit to being a bit guilty of 'engaging' these people (if you've read the conversations between me and @nicsheri you know that already), but it's a case of knowing what I'm getting into.  I can't abide by people who bully, be they real celebs or just average joes, so I tend to take them on and out them for what they are.  Block them and ignore them, but report them to Twitter, Facebook and everywhere else.  Right now, my standing up against them has resulted in a growing group of 'anti JFO' twitter accounts.  I'm blocking them without comment at this point, because Twitter won't do a damn thing about them.
