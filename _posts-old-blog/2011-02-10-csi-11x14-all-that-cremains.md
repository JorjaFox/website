Katee Sackhoff guest stars in tonight's CSI.  So yeah, they're pandering to the fans again.

<h3>Official Release</h3>
A thrift store donation turns gruesome when a dead body is found in a box; meanwhile, Langston's wife pays a surprise visit to the crime lab.

That was adorable.  It was funny, it was a little slow paced, and I saw the killer a mile away (maybe she'll be in therapy with Hannah).  Also now I really want a buddy cop show with Jorja and Katee Sackhoff.  I hope Katee comes back next season!
