**Updated at 1:45pm ET**

Many huge thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/dropdeaddivatv">@dropdeaddivatv</a> who replied with this happy news:

So yes, we get Jorja next week.

<em>Orginal post follows.</em>

Short version: Unless you have **PROOF**, in a press release from <em>Drop Dead Diva</em> or Lifetime TV, take a breath, she's still on for Sunday the 16th. Okay?

Honestly, there's been no word from the official sources on this, and their website still touts the 'Soccer Mom' episode.

See? That screenshot is from LifeTime's TV Schedule for 8/16 (as of 9 AM ET Monday).

Just because she wasn't in the promo doesn't mean she's not in the episode, so everyone please breath and stop emailing unless you've got some proof behind your rumor. Which is kind of a general rule of thumb anyway.
