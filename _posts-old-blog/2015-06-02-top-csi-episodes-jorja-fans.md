I pulled a list of all the best CSI episodes for Sara (and by extension) Jorja and didn't sort them, but I thought it'd be fun to look back and see what I loved the most. They're in order by air date. Are there any I'm missing? Ones I got wrong? Speak up!

## Sex, Lies and Larvae

This was the first time we got to see Sara lash out at someone. I remember thinking "Hello, there's some back story here..." and wondering what it could be (besides abuse). This is also the episode where Sara stopped eating meat.

## Too Tough to Die

Heartbreaking. Just ... We'll come back to it with _The Happy Place_, but this one was the first where Sara chased rabbits to the extent of losing herself.

## You've Got Male

The pay-off from all those small moments where Sara is too invested is a case where she's too invested and has to reach out to people at the end. Bonus? The phone call at the end of the episode is to Nick.

## One Hit Wonder

We didn't know it at the time, but this was when we started to learn about Sara being in foster care. It also started the great "Who is her brother!?" debacle, which wasn't cleared up until much, much later. The storyline however told us so much about how Sara _wanted_ to trust people and hurt when she was betrayed. This is a character point that we come back to many times.

## Crash & Burn

When Sara found out she was the other woman? Yikes! Having her heart broken like that was horrible, and yet it bridged the chasm that had existed for three seasons with Sara and Catherine. Something good had to come from it. Again, though, Sara trusted and was hurt for it.

## Early Rollout

This episode I love because of the moment when Brass reached out to Sara. It didn't help, but it set their friendship as a quiet, stable, shoulder type thing. Sara repays the favor later on with Ellie.

## Bloodlines

I'm honestly glad we didn't see the whole alcohol thing play out any further, but this was a nice touch back to someone who had been struggling and finally had to get some help.

## No Humans Involved

And now, finally, we know something more. Sara was in foster care. At the end of the episode, Sara searches the Nexis database for "THE PEOPLE VS. LAURA SIDLE W/2; MODESTO, CALIFORNIA, 1984"

## Committed

This episode. THIS episode. God. Rip my heart out, Jorja, and make me feel all the pain. She played it so right, so note perfect that you saw those older episodes again, where Sara lashed out at men mistreating women, and you saw the hurt child.

## The Unusual Suspect

Another case where Sara feels for the 'victim' but this time she's played for a fool. If you take the agony of _Hit & Run_ and then combine it with the raw angst of _Committed_, it's really no wonder Sara's down.

## Empty Eyes

You can't blame Sara for taking the death hard here. She was (nearly) played by the 'survivor' who turned out to be anything but. This time she had Grissom to lean on afterwards, but that doesn't end well at all, because of serial killer on the loose.

## Dead Doll

I've said it many times. Giving Jorja the chance to do the majority of the episode with _no_ dialogue was insanely brave and the payoff is phenomenal. We get to see Sara's brains in the face of danger. While the CSIs are scrambling, Sara's on the ball and on point. She will survive.

## Goodbye and Good Luck

But. All those years of chasing rabbits had a price. Sara's never been whole to start with and she sure wasn't after being kidnapped. This swan song felt like Sara.

## The Happy Place

I almost left this out. I don't really feel like we got any growth from Sara here, but at the same time, touching back on "Too Tough To Die" was a brilliant choice. It reinforced Sara's lack of faith in humanity. Perhaps even in herself...

## House of Hoarders

Back in Las Vegas, Sara emphasizes with the young man whose mother is a hoarder. For once, her intuition is right. Interestingly, she never lost that desire to believe in people, even though she knew they'd stomp all over her.

## The Two Mrs. Grissoms

I always love episodes where Sara carries the majority of the case and the drama. A mother-in-law, the woman she thinks her husband should have married, and a Skype with Grissom? The only thing better would have been if the ex had done it.

## Bittersweet

Stockholm syndrome was an interesting choice for the episode. Sara still tries to believe in people, and gets burned in a new way. I did like that it wasn't the same old same old.

## Risky Business Class

Okay. This was weird. We have to talk about the GSR elephant in the room here. What's going on with Grissom? The little dribs and drabs of the cracks in the relationship are coming to a head and we're not going to like it.

## Forget Me Not

And now we know. And now we hate it. And now we see an off-camera development. I didn't like the episode, but I marveled at how well Jorja nailed the emotions and the difficulties. I can only imagine how draining that was to film.

## Girls Gone Wild

"Who's Beyonc√©?" Besides being hilarious, Sara showing she's really not comfortable being a girly girl harkens back to when Catherine asked her if her dad ever called her pretty. It's a totally different world for Sara.

## Bad Blood

We all knew Sara wouldn't die, but I liked how the whole thing played out. Her fear and doubts felt very real and very tangible.

## Girls Gone Wilder

Sara's still not comfortable girling around, but she's trying to grow and change and become more than she was. Maybe it's related to _Bad Blood_, maybe not.

## Dead Woods

And it comes back to here. Suddenly we have a child Sara believes in, who survived a horrible day like she did, who doesn't remember everything, who is alone. Just like Sara. And this time, this time she wins. This time Sara saves the family, the child, and the memories. This time there's closure for everyone except Sara, who accepts the truth. She will never know.
