<blockquote>**How long have you been working on this show**

About 7 years ago, I started to listen heavily to her music, watching videos and reading anything I could get my hands on. I wrote monologues in her voice and sang her songs at an open mic night at The Gardenia Club in West Hollywood. I won a screenwriting grant at University of Southern California and used that to get some musical charts in order and prototype a show. We performed the show once at USC and Jorja Fox from CSI was there and decided she wanted to be involved. She helped bring the idea to The Lily Tomlin/Jane Wagner Cultural Arts Center, part of the Gay and Lesbian Center in LA. We had a small successful run there but I knew the final frontier was New York. Weâ€™ve overcome some incredible obstacles; it is a dream come true to be running FOREVER DUSTY at New World Stages.</blockquote>
