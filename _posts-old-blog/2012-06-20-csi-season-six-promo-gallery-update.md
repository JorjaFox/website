Seventy-Nine (79) episode stills.

Ginourmous Promos.

You kind of forget how amazing Season Six was until you get to spend a day looking back on it. Or three days. I had to sort and organize all these, and then I found out that some images wereÂ _too big_! They broke the server. Oops.

So the Promo Photos aren't as big as they could be. They're half as big (the big ones), topping out around 3000px wide. Every time I tried the 5000px ones, the images were 10megs and they wouldn't render.

Still, they look real good!
