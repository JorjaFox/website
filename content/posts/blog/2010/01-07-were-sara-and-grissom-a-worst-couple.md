Gil and Sara on 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'**
Sure, there were plenty of Geek Love fans who were dying to see Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) get together, but even they were thrown for a loop at the way the hook-up finally happened. Or, rather, didn't. Six seasons in, we learned that Grissom and Sara had already gotten together ... two years ago! We were spared any awkward morning-after regrets, but fans felt cheated and the words "jump" and "shark" were definitely thrown around. Although Petersen is now gone and Fox is an occasional guest, CBS has promised an eventual Grissom-Sara reunion, no doubt, timed for sweeps.</blockquote>
