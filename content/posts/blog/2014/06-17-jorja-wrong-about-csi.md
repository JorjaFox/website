While some of this is a rehash from the article about [how Jorja thought _CSI_ would last six weeks](http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/jorja-fox-thought-csi-crime-scene-investigation-would-last-six-weeks/story-e6frfmyi-1226867996661), news.au.com celebrates _CSI_ hitting 14 seasons in Australia by asking Eric and Jorja about CSI.

But Fox has her own theory on why the original drama in the _CSI_ franchise endures.

“I have often thought of our show really as an action-adventure show,” she says.

“I think it’s supposed to be a mystery-suspense show.

“And there are a whole bunch of really good reasons to tune in, but one of them is you are going to be in for an amazing ride, an amazing hour of an exciting, dodgy, what’s-going-to-happen-next kind of ride.”

Surely Fox had no idea _CSI_ would become this monster hit when she signed to play Sidle 13 years ago.

“You know, when I read the script I was blown away by it,” she says.
