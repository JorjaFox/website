Jorja was good, there was a wonderful veneer of barely controlled rage about the abusive husband that was very Sara. Also Sara was very much Sara in doing math in her head (or rather, out loud) and teasing Nick about things. Basically it felt like that old-school season 2 Sara with a bit more control around her. And that's as it should be for 12 years later!

Tweets! George was on as <a href="http://twitter.com/csicast">@CSICast</a>, and has apparently cut his hair off (I asked where it went, he replied "went down the drain of my sink at home" because he's silly).

There's another new CSI next week, but Jorja's not in it.

Oh and yes, Sara's birthday is back to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season14/12-keepcalm/kcaco-074.jpg">being in September</a>.
