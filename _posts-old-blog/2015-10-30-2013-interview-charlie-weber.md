Back in 2013, Charlie Weber showed up on the show _Warehouse 13_ as a gay character, and was interviewed by Logo about it. Why do you care? Charlie was also on _CSI_ in the episode <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/recaps/csi/empty-eyes/">Empty Eyes</a> and talked about that being one of his most amazing moments as an actor:
<blockquote>**Looking at your filmography, you’ve been on a ton of great shows with some amazing actors, _Reaper_, _House_, _Buffy_. Was there an actor you worked with that really surprised you?**

I’ve been so lucky that I just walked on set after set with just such welcoming actors, and that’s great because you hear horror stories. But I remember having to do a very emotional scene on_CSI_, and at the time, _CSI_ was the #1 show, 30 million viewers each week, absurd numbers, you would think that if there was one set there would be big egos, it would be that set. But I had this one emotional scene across from Jorja Fox. She was so gracious and open and warm, it helped me get to where I needed to be. I remember that vividly. They shot me first, she was so patient. I had to excuse myself from the set for a moment, and she was so open to what I needed as an actor. Here I was just a guest spot, and she was a regular on the #1 show on television, and she was focused on making me comfortable.

That's basically the epitome of why Jorja is so damn cool.

If you're looking for Charlie now, you can find him on _How to Get Away with Murder_. He's the creepy bearded guy who kills people.
