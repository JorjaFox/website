<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/12/csi-11.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/12/csi-11-100x100.png" alt="" title="csi-11" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2819" /></a> Am I allowed to make _Spinal Tap_ jokes here, or are you guys going to look at me weirdly?  "Ours go to 11!"  Actually, ours goes _PAST_ eleven.

If you hadn't guessed from the spoilers of "The Two Mrs. Grissoms," Jorja's stay on _CSI_ has been extended. It's important to note that we do not know how long we get her for, but I think we'll have her till season's end.  Or until Momma Grissom stabs her.  That's a JOKE!

From <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/12/17/burn-notice-csi-gossip-girl-spoilers/">Sandra Gonzalez at Inside TV (via EW.com)</a>

<blockquote>And I’ve saved the best for last. Jorja Fox fans have emailed me in a fury about rumors that the lovely forensic scientist would only be on 11 episodes. But the CSI honchos were happy to report that while they’re still discussing exactly how many episodes she will appear in, fans can “look for more than 11.”</blockquote>

So there's that.

Yay!
