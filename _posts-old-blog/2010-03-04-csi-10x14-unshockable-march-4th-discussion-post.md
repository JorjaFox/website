Discuss the episode here. Spoilers will happen and, as always, I'll update once the ep airs and we have caps etc.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
When a band member of Rascal Flatts is electrocuted by his own guitar during a concert, the CSI team investigates if it was a case of foul play.

This one gets four stars, for _finally_ mentioning that Sara and Grissom are, you know, married, and had a honeymoon. Looking for bugs in a canoe.  Oh, you silly scientists.
