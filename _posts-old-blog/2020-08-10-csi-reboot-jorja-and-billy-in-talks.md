Let's not bury the lede. The reboot is now being pitched as a 'short' series (so think of it like a mini series or a more UK style series) wherein some of the old guard return and we would be introduced to the new set of CSI misfits and crime solvers.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">As reported in February, CBS is developing a&nbsp;short-run&nbsp;_CSI_&nbsp;revival&nbsp;that that would commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original series’ launch.&nbsp;_Elementary_&nbsp;vet Jason Tracey is shepherding the project. The follow-up would once again be set in Las Vegas and, if deals can be made, feature a number of original cast members — but which ones?Sources confirm to TVLine that original stars&nbsp;William Petersen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jorja Fox&nbsp;are in advanced talks to reprise their respective roles as Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle.&nbsp;Petersen and Fox would be surrounded by a new crop of&nbsp;_CSI_ characters. An insider cautions that CBS, which declined to comment for this story, has yet to formally order the project.<cite>Source: <a href="https://tvline.com/2020/08/10/csi-reboot-returning-cast-cbs-jorja-fox-sara/">Michael Ausiello, TV|Line</a></cite></blockquote>

Like TV|Line's insider, I do caution everyone to not count their CSIs before they sign. But. Assuming a perfect world, and remembering that Marg's a regular on another series, who would you like to see return?
