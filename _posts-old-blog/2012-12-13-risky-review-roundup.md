<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/12/heart.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6076" alt="Lonely Heart" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/12/heart-276x140.png" width="276" height="140" /></a>I'm not the only person who ponders about these episodes. Usually the reviews aren't all about Sara, but for what are probably obvious reasons, this week is a little different.

Everyone seems pretty conflicted about this episode, which means it was probably pretty good! After all, we want an episode people are talking about. Sadly, <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2012/12/csi-wins-the-hour-despite-drop-in-ratings/">CSI dropped to a series low last night</a>. On the other hand, it was up against Barbara Walters's most interesting people, which is always a huge draw. Interesting competition. Normally Barbara's against nothing, and wins the night.

On to reviews!

Jim Garner of TV Fanatic says:
<blockquote>First, I’m thrilled that we got an episode that focused on this team member, specifically her marriage to Grissom. Many fans have wondered why there isn't more mention of Grissom or why Sara doesn't seem to acknowledge that she’s even hitched.

I do have a couple of questions, though:

1. How long ago was she in San Francisco to work with Wilson? Their conversation gave clear indication it had been several years, but if it was before she came to Las Vegas that would be more than _13_ years ago. Talk about carrying a flame for someone for a long time.

2. The preview teased "An old lover of Sara's." Did anyone get the feeling they had been lovers?!? I sensed an attraction, but not that sort of vibe. Then again, Jorja Fox can be a bit tough to read, so maybe the crooked smile meant lover.

Either way, I hope we get more of Sara and her relationship; I would like to see it go somewhere. It just seems like a boat anchor around her neck; she can’t date because she married to a ghost, she can’t hold bidirectional conversations because William Petersen isn't really on the show, we only get one side if she talks to him at all.

It’s just frustrating watching the character float in limbo!</blockquote>

Kristen Elizabeth of TVEquals shares some of your GSR fears:
<blockquote>Now that all of my fellow GSR fans have breathed a collective sigh of relief, although it might be a bit premature, I can honestly say that “Risky Business Class,” this week’s episode of **CSI**, will only ever be memorable as the episode that clearly exposed the rift in Grissom and Sara’s marriage.

There have been signs that the long distance arrangement is wearing on her all season, but it usually takes something big to make us wake up and realize there’s a problem in our lives, and for Sara it took the appearance of Doug Wilson, an NSTB investigator and former fling from San Francisco, who arrived in Vegas to investigate the crash of a small charter plane just off the Strip.

[...]

Seeing Doug definitely threw Sara for a loop, but while she ignored a call from Grissom, she never crossed any lines. Even the hug she gave Doug before he left town was less about wanting to connect him with him and more about just wanting to hold someone since she couldn’t hold her husband. He brought up some great memories for her, but Sara is not a cheater, and had things gone any further, I probably wouldn’t be writing these reviews anymore.</blockquote>
