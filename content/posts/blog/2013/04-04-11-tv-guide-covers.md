In the last 60 years of TV Guide, Jorja's been on the cover (as the main article or a sidebar shot) eleven times. Which isn't really that bad. You can see them all on the <a href="http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/archive/suboffer/page/gallery">TV Guide Cover Gallery</a>, which even has a search that works if you put in 'Jorja'!

Here's the eleven for you.
