## Synopsis

At a critical juncture in a bowling tournament, a head comes out of the ball feed. The victim, Ronny Tobin, works at the bowling alley, but no body is found on the premise. Ronny's head was sawn off by hand and transported in a bag used by Kevin X, one of the players in the tournament, who had also lost to Ronny in a pick-up game. Blood spatter and the rest of Ronny's body, indicates that Ronny was shot at the employment of his homeless friend, Vitas.

While the CSIs suspect Vitas, when they review camera footage they determine Ronny's girlfriend, Shea Lammet, is a suspect as they can place her at the pinsetter, where the head was inserted into the ball feed.

Shea was cheating on Ronny with Chevy Cigs, the other bowler in the tournament, and he accuses her of the killing. When Ronny's blood is found in the finger holes of Chevy's ball, the CSIs are certain he's involved. The game picks up two days later, and Chevy is arrested at the game, but not before he defeats Kevin X.

The original plan was for Shea to lure Chevy to the supplier where Vitas worked, and for Ronny to scare him. Instead, Chevy shot Ronny and coerced Shea into helping him cover up the crime. Shea put the head in the ball feed to give Chevy something he'd never forget, as payback for dumping her.

Ray works a case of a suicide in jail of a woman, Carla York, who claims she was innocent of killing her husband, James. Hodges assists him in proving that not only was Carla innocent, but her sister committed the crime. The sister confesses, but claims she did it to save Carla's daughter from James, who had multiple other children with other women, all of whom were 'messed up.'

## Review

Sara is one of the primaries on the case, collecting evidence and interviewing suspects. After the case is solved, she calls Ray to ask him to join them bowling. Sara is not a great bowler, but seems to enjoy herself.
