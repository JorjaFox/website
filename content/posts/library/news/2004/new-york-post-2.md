Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, says a "misunderstanding" caused her not to show up for work last week.

According to published reports, Fox was axed after she failed to meet a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, that she would continue to report for work despite whatever contractual issues she might have.

Fox was said to be "mystified" because she believed she'd mailed her "pledge" letter in on time.

"E! News Live" was the first to update the Fox situation when it reported that she will definitely return to the show. However, as of yesterday, that wasn't yet a done deal.

Eads, who plays Nick Stokes, was also fired last week after failing to show up for work.

He told reporters on Wednesday that he'd "overslept," that it was all a misunderstanding and that he hoped to get his job back. His fate remained uncertain as of yesterday.

Both Fox and Eads reportedly pull in $100,000-per-episode on TV's top-rated drama, which is entering its fifth season.
