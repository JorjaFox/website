If you used FeedBurner's email update list to get alerted to when new posts were made, you've already been moved over to the internal mailing list, and should have gotten an email from the site about it.

If you want to sign up to get daily digests of new posts on JFO, go to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/updates">https://jorjafox.net/updates</a>. If you're a registered user, you'll be able to turn it on from your profile. If not, you can just sign up (it's double opt in, to prevent dorks).
