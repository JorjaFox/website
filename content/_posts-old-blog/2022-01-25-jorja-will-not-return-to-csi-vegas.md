<p>Jorja announced on Twitter that she <strong><em>will not</em> </strong>be returning to<em> CSI: Vegas:</em></p>

<p>Her summation "So goes Grissomâ€¦..So goes Sara. Wherever they go, they belong together." is the greatest testament to her deep understanding of both what made the show a success, and why they need to be together.</p>

<p>What does that mean here? Not a whole lot! Just won't be scrambling to recap/screencap.</p>

<p>I am in full support of her choice and can't wait to see what she does next.</p>
