<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3514" title="BuddyPress" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/07/BuddyPress-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="152" />I know, like we **need** another social network!

Instead of folding in an external tool, like Livejournal or Facebook (or Google+), I turned JFO into a BuddyPress site a year or so ago.  The goal with this was to let you communicate with each other in a safe Jorja based site, without having to share all your details with everyone everywhere.

BuddyPress is a mini-social media tool for WordPress that lets you make your own community.  For the nerds of us, it's like making your own Ning install.  Cool.  For the rest of us, it's an eye-roll and a 'Why?'

At the most basic, your account here lets you use Groups (they're like FaceBook 'pages' more than forums) and send Messages to each other.  You also get email Notifications (which can be turned off) when new Activity happens and win surprise Achievements when you do something.

Since that's a lot of new terms to memorize, I made some BuddyPress Help Docs for you, which explains what all the various moving parts are.

Do you need an account?

**No.**

Seriously, if all you want is to read the news and leave comments on the blog, that will _always_ remain open for people, logged in or not, to do.  Yes, you have to leave your email address (only I ever see it) and pick a user name (you can't use someone else's if they've registered), but this site will be free and open.

If you want to play in the groups, though, you do need to register.  This is to keep out spammers.

In the next few months, I'll be slowly tweaking the grey bar up at top of the site that logged in users see to allow you to bounce around the site even faster.  Until then, the 'Profile' section on the sidebar has drop downs sections for you to check out things.

Let me know if things are confusing, and if I can explain anything better!  I know it's all clear to me, but I've been head down playing in this for years.
