## Synopsis

Now that Catherine heads up a swing-shift crew that includes Warrick and Nick, the three of them rarely get a chance to work alongside Grissom anymore. Tonight, however, the whole gang is thrown back together to investigate a high-profile murder, but Catherine isn't too happy about it. A powerful casino owner, who claimed to have dirt on almost every prominent person in Vegas, is found dead in his driveway. Catherine's team is the first to respond, so she takes it personally when Ecklie calls in Grissom to head up their case, which turns out to be one of their kinkiest ever.

## Review

After her initial appearance at the scene, Sara doesn't have much to do with the case. After Grissom and Catherine discover the victim's secret life, Sara helps Nick to strip apart the toybox -- they discover the victim's secret files; they also discover a photo of an unknown baby dated 2001. Sara and Sofia discuss not only the unknown lactating woman, but the mystery car as well.

## Notes

* Sara works well with Sofia in this, despite previous reservations.

## Quotes

**Sara:** People who live in houses like these don't get oil leaks.

**Curtis:** We've excluded Mrs. Eiger. How long can a woman lactate after giving birth?\
**Sara:** I had a professor in college, her six-year-old used to come in for lunch. I guess they'll go as long as you let them.\
**Curtis:** What, the boobs or the kids? That's a two-legged topless buffet. _(she looks at the file folder)_ Ugh.\
**Sara:** I'm thinking, you know, if you commit to something every Thursday night, you've got to be getting something good out of it.

**Sara:** Maybe we're looking for a cash cow.
