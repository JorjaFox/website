First of all, please remember they're filming<i> multiple</i> episodes at once this season. Sara's not in the opener a lot because she is all over Ep #3, "Bad Blood." There are only a few scenes with Sara and she spends most of it working blood. Likely because Finn, the Blood Whisperer, is busy on another angle of the case with her boyfriend. Yeaaaaah.

Anyway, few scenes, nothing about her life etc. So two stars. It was a good episode otherwise. Nice to see a season long killer arc again. Been a while, hasn't it?
