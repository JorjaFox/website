I don't know about you, but it's been pretty hot here.  Just the kind of weather that makes you think 'Summer'  And with summer comes the birthday fundraiser for Surfrider! Cleaning the ocean is even more important than normal after the Gulf Disaster, but with Climate Change on the rise making sure the water is fresh and clean for everyone become crucial to ensuring our survival as a species.

Once again, I'm using Crowdrise to handle the money.  You just head over to the <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jfo-bday2011">JFO Birthday 2011</a> page and press that nice big 'Donate' button on the side there.
