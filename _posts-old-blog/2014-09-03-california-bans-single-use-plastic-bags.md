<blockquote>The bill, SB 270, authored by California State Senators Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima), Kevin DeLeon (D-Los Angeles) and Ricardo Lara (D-Huntington Park/Long Beach), bans grocery stores and pharmacies from offering customers single-use plastic bags beginning July 1, 2015. And, by the following July, the law will apply to convenience stores and liquor stores. It will impose a minimum 10-cent fee on any paper or reusable plastic bags sold to customers who forgot to bring their own bags when they shop, and it will set strict standards for what types of bags count as reusable.</blockquote>
I nearly always have a reusable bag on hand anyway, since I hate the plastic. This is great.
