<p>CBS has released their new 2021-22 schedule and the time and date for <em>CSI: Vegas</em> is set at 10pm ET (9pm CT), on Wednesdays. We do not yet have the release DAY yet, but should soon.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/shows/csi-vegas/releases/view?id=57660">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The three highly anticipated new dramas for fall with marquee value and built-in viewer appeal include new chapters in the Network’s most successful brands: NCIS: HAWAI ' I, starring Vanessa Lachey as the first female Special Agent in Charge of the NCIS Pearl Harbor field office; FBI: INTERNATIONAL, from Emmy Award-winning producer Dick Wolf; and CSI: VEGAS, the sequel to the Network’s global hit “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” with original cast members William Petersen and Jorja Fox joining forces with the new team lead by Paula Newsome.</p></blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>WEDNESDAYS</strong> – SURVIVOR and CSI are back on a night featuring masterful strategy and teamwork! Drop your buffs! SURVIVOR, hosted by Jeff Probst, returns to outwit, outplay and outlast, kicking off the night at 8:00 PM, with two new seasons in fall and spring. At 9:00 PM, the torch is passed to competition series TOUGH AS NAILS, which celebrates hardworking everyday Americans who consider the calluses on their hands a badge of honor, hosted by Phil Keoghan. Then, the new chapter of one of the most-watched drama series of the 21st century, CSI: VEGAS, caps the night at 10:00 PM.</p></blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>CSI: VEGAS</strong>, the sequel to the Network’s global hit “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” opens a brand-new chapter in Las Vegas—the city where it all began. Facing an existential threat that could bring down the entire Crime Lab and release thousands of convicted killers back onto the neon-lit streets of Vegas, a brilliant new team of investigators led by Maxine Roby (Paula Newsome) must enlist the help of old friends, Gil Grissom (William Petersen), Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and David Hodges (Wallace Langham). This combined force will deploy the latest forensic techniques to do what they do best—follow the evidence—in order to preserve and serve justice in Sin City. Jason Tracey serves as executive producer and showrunner; Jerry Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman, KristieAnne Reed, Anthony Zuiker, Carol Mendelsohn, Ann Donahue, Craig O’Neill, William Petersen and Cindy Chvatal are also executive producers. Uta Briesewitz is an executive producer and directed (initial episode only) from a script by Tracey. The series is produced by CBS Studios in association with Jerry Bruckheimer Television.</p><p><strong>CSI: VEGAS</strong> stars original “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” cast members William Petersen, Jorja Fox and Wallace Langham, who will reprise their roles as Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle and David Hodges, respectively; Paula Newsome as Maxine Roby; Matt Lauria as Joshua Folsom; Mandeep Dhillon as Allie Rajan; and Mel Rodriguez as Hugo Ramirez.</p></blockquote>
