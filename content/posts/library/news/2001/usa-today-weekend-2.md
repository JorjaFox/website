I'm one of the many fans of CBS' hit crime drama, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation". Tell me about Jorja Fox, one of the forensic investigators.
Roseanne Turner, Denver, Ind.

She has a talent for being in the show of the moment: Fox, 32, was in ER early on, The West Wing last year and now CSI, plus the acclaimed indie movie "Memento". The New York native is unmarried but "involved, and not allowed to talk about it. I've been sworn to secrecy!" She can talk about her love of animals (she has a dog and two cats); she headed back to New York on her break from CSI to work with the ASPCA. "I'm the wimp of the cast, a little squeamish," she says when asked about her gruesome scenes. "When I met [co-star] Billy [Petersen] and the creator [Anthony Zuiker] for lunch, I order this delicious lunch and they start talking about heads in popcorn containers."
