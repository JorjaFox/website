Unlike Sara Sidle's mysterious brother, Maggie Doyle from ER not only had a brother, but we saw him on screen! Maggie's brother, Jimmy, had Downs Syndrome, and when a patient with Downs is in the ER (in the episode <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Faith">Faith</a>), Maggie brings Jimmy over to keep her company.

So here's some fun for you. Blair Williamson played Jimmy. Back in 2012, Jorja was at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/awards/pub/20070700-maa/">Media Access Awards</a>. So was Blair! They met up and had a photo taken with Blair's girlfriend, Susie. What's the fun? Well in addition to ER, Blair was in the CSI episode <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Snuff">Snuff</a> (he was the B case that Grissom worked on).
