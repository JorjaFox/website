<blockquote>**_CSI_ (CBS)**

Premieres: Sunday, Sept. 28 at 10/9c

**Where We Left Off:** The team worked with a retired cop to solve a small-town murder with remarkable similarities to one the ex-cop investigated 25 years ago. And the show set up veteran cast member Paul Guilfoyle's exit when, after Capt. Brass' troubled daughter Ellie attempted suicide, he made an abrupt decision to focus on his relationship with his daughter.

**What's Next:** While the premiere will explain Brass' "extended leave of absence" the CSIs will quickly jump into a serial killer case that will run throughout the season. Mark-Paul Gosselaar guest-stars as a murderer on death row whom D.B. Russell convicted years ago, as well as his identical twin brother, who may have picked up where his sibling left off. "Is it an acolyte? Has the person in prison found a new partner? Or worst case scenario, did Russell put the wrong person away?" executive producer Don McGill teases. Elsewhere, Finlay will get a new love interest in Human Target's Mark Valley, and Greg and Sara's close bond will be explored further. Plus: Look for another girls' night out episode!</blockquote>

I believe Sara and Greg will be bonding in episode 3, when they're in the plastic tent together (which happens after some CDC level exposures, if those bunny suits are any indication). Girls Gone Wilder, episode 5, will show why CSIs need to never take a vacation.

Also they're not replacing Brass, so get ready for a round of rotating cops.
