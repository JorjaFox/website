Another year in the books, and JFO is another year older... It can _vote_ now.
<h3>Jorja In The World</h3>
She sure did a lot for Lion Ark! No, I still haven't watched it. It's a lot to take in, and I know I'll cry all over it.
<h3>CSI Stuff</h3>
"Forget Me Not" was the killer (heh) episode of the year, causing the most traffic on the site. It was also pretty harsh for the GSR fans out there. A lot of you have been reeling ever since, and I can't blame you!
<h3>Site Development</h3>
This part is nerdy. With the assistance of a very helpful coworker, my friend Taupecat, and a lot of patience, I've been streamlining the code on JFO to run faster, which also meant adjusting _how_ I develop everything. It's now more mobile responsive, retina capable, and gosh darn it, prettier. The work I've done on this site actually helps me at my job, and really lead to me having it at all. For me, that makes all the difference.
<h3>The Numbers</h3>
Every year, Jetpack (my stats app) sends me a review of how busy the site was. This year they compared us to the Louvre:
<blockquote>The Louvre Museum has 8.5 million visitors per year. This blog was viewed about 580,000 times in 2013. If it were an exhibit at the Louvre Museum, it would take about 25 days for that many people to see it.

In 2013, there were 341 new posts, growing the total archive of this blog to 1,032 posts.

The busiest day of the year was February 20th with 9,567 views. The most popular post that day was<a id="busiest-post" href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/forget-me-not/" target="_blank">"Forget Me Not" Discussion Post</a>.</blockquote>
But those aren't the full numbers! See Jetpack only tracks the blog. I have Google running to track everything and that number for views? 960,265. So close to 1,000,000! No way to get 40k in a day though, so oh well. Does this matter at all? Yes and no. It means that we're getting enough traffic to make the ad revenue start to be effective (also my ebook sales are doing well so the websites are paying for themselves now). Also it gives me a nice view of where people are visiting from:

The United Kingdom &amp; Brazil were not far behind.[/caption]

The traffic is roughly 10% more than last year.
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
A lot of the same old same old, really. I don't really tend to make grand sweeping plans for the site, until I hit a wall and shout "Damn it, why doesn't this do what I want!?" That's when things happen. So ... "Damn it, why don't I go see Lion Ark!?"

Okay, now I'll go see it.
