<h3>Recap</h3>
<del>Coming Soon!</del>

I was about to give this two stars. And then the last scene of Act 4 blew my mind.  I'm video capping two scenes and will post them tomorrow.  Yeah I'm going to make you wait because I need to sleep.  But it was a good episode.  They're doing quite a lot with Sara and schizophrenics these days!
