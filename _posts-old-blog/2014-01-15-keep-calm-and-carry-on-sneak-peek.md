Exclusive CSI Sneak Peek: Ethan Embry Can't Hardly Wait to Shake Sara and Nick, from TV|Line
<blockquote>Is it just us, or does something stink about the janitor Ethan Embry (Once Upon a Time) is playing on tonight’s CSI (CBS, 10/9c)?

In the crime drama’s winter premiere, titled “Keep Calm and Carry On,” a petty crime committed aboard a plane to Vegas becomes a murder investigation when a female passenger is found dead.

In this sneak peek, Sidle and Stokes ask Embry’s character, Jefferson Nalley, about his possible connection to the victim.</blockquote>
