**The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What's going to happen in season seven?**

The producers keep it secret. It's impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven't though about killing Sara. She's had almost everything else happen to her - arrest, humiliation, bad dating ... She's been the team's scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest. At last, I can finally smile on screen!

**After seven years are you used to seeing corpses?**

I'm stronger now, but I sometimes want to puke when I see all the special effects made by our special effects! Outdoing other TV shows has become a game for them. They never run out of ideas to show amazing deaths.

**All this [death] doesn't seem to make for a cheerful atmosphere on the set!**

Not at all! We laugh and we play music. We made a band - the actors and the technicians. Marg Helgenberger plays piano, Gary Dourdan plays bass and Robert David Hall plays guitar. I even want to film one of our impromptu gigs for our fans!

**When you meet fans, what do you talk about ?**

All of them want to see Sara and Gil have a love story, which is going to happen in the new season. But "CSI" isn't about the private lives of its heroes. Mysteries are at the heart of every episode.

**Are you surprised by the infatuation of viewers about "CSI" ?**

What really surprised me is the interest our fans have in crimes. Some of them tell me complex scenarios about the best way to kill someone. At first, I was terrified about it and I felt like I had serial killers in front of me! Now I'm more relaxed and I joke with them.

**We know very little about your private life. Why are you so secret ?**

I think it's very important to keep the mystery secret. And also it's good for the audience, so that people don't confuse me with my character on "CSI".

**You never act in movies during your summer holiday. Is it a personal choice ?**

I work 14 hour days for nine and a half months and I don't want to run everywhere during my holidays. Seven years ago, I created my own theater troupe. That's how I relax.

**Do you have a theater project going on?**

I'm a producer of "Dear Bernard", a musical comedy about an English girl who comes to Hollywood to be successful. I also suggested to the "CSI" producers that we write a musical episode for this season. Wouldn't it be funny to see Grissom and his team singing during autopsies? We could even pretend it was all Sara's dream!
