The sidebar for the blog has a new section for 'Affiliate Links'. The Jorja All Around link is pretty obvious to everyone, but why are EW and TV Guide there as well?

The answer is simple.  Both EW and TV Guide have been supplying JFO with news before it breaks about Jorja and CSI for the last few months.  During this time, we've been working out how best to associate ourselves.  I want to keep the links both obvious and non-obtrusive to visitors, which is a pretty trick if you can do it.

Please note: JFO receives no funding from either source. We're not selling out at all, we're simply publicly acknowledging two of major news contributors.
