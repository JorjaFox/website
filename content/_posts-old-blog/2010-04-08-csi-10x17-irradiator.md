<h2>Official Release</h2>
When the CSI team investigates the brutal murder of a family, they trace the killer to the house next door, which might belong to the 'Dr. Jekyll' serial killer.

As usual, speculate and spoil yourselves. I'll update the post once I have screencaps etc.

Updated at 10:25pm ET.  This was ... Wow. I enjoyed a CSI episode on it's own merits for the first time since probably "Ending Happy."  I'm a twisted person.  Good episode, obvious twists, and a lot of Sara!
