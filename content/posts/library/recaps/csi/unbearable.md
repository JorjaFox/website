## Synopsis

Grissom, Sofia, Sara and Greg investigate the disappearance of a woman coming home from a night out with a friend, her abandoned car found on the edge of a highway. Catherine, Warrick and Nick investigate the deaths of a hunter and his prey, a Kodiak bear.

_Note: this episode of CSI was the winner of a Genesis Award ([Humane Society](http://www.hsus.org/)) for its portrayal of canned hunts._

## Review

Sara, Greg, Grissom and Sofia check out a body dump. During the case she finds Grissom talking alone with Sofia, and hesitantly interrupts them. Greg asks her what happened with Ecklie, and while she doesn't tell him about it, she does appreciate his asking. After they solve the case, Greg discovers the motive and lets both Sara and Sofia know -- when he comments about Sofia fitting in, Sara doesn't say anything and walks away.

## Notes

* Sara appreciates Greg inquiring about her blow-up with Ecklie, though she doesn't tell him anything.
* Sara does not express a high opinion of Sofia.
* Sara, as usual, gets to check out the car involved.

## Quotes

**Greg:** I don't mean to pry, but you want to talk about what happened with you and Ecklie?
**Sara:** Not really.
**Greg:** I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm a good listener.
**Sara:** I blew up at Ecklie. It was very unprofessional. And very satisfying, and now I'm moving on. Thanks for asking.

**Greg:** If you've added up every cent I've made in my entire life, I still wouldn't be able to afford half this car. _(They walk up to the car.)_
**Sara:** Yeah, but why would you want it? The insurance premiums are sky-high. Not to mention theft, scratches.
**Greg:** It's art. And I'd have every girl in the neighborhood after me.
**Curtis:** Not when they saw your apartment.
**Sara:** You've been to Greg's apartment?
**Curtis:** Who hasn't?

**Curtis:** Listen, you guys, I'll catch up later. _(she walks away)_
**Greg:** Hmm. She's fitting in pretty well, huh?
**Sara:** _(gives him a look and walks away without saying anything)_
