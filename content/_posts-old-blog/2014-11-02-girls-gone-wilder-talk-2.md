<i><del>Attention East and Central US. You will <b>not</b> get to see CSI tonight. Football. Again. Boo. I will watch it (actually have seen it this morning thanks to my DVR) so I will recap and screen cap</del>.

Okay, apparently <strong>no one</strong> gets to see this. Except DirecTV recorded it for me last Sunday, so expect a recap and screen caps tomorrow, same as always. I just finished watching it.</i>

Okay! Let's try this again.
