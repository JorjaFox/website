Hi again.

So yay, it finally aired! What did you think? I enjoyed the episode, personally. The last scene with Sara and Morgan was worth the re-watch. Finn was oddly apart from them for most of the episode, which was an interesting choice I felt.

It's still a five star episode and it's still got 213 images. Enjoy!

Next week is "The Twin Paradox" complete with Sara.
