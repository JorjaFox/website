This week's Fall Sneak Peek from TV Guide includes a two-page spread on CSI:

<blockquote><strong>After 15 years and countless cases, <em>CSI</em> closes the lab for good with a two-hour send-off.</strong>

THE MOST POPULAR, groundbreaking and influential whodunit in TV history has to go out with a bang, right? <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> ends its 15-season run with "Immortality," a two-hour episode about an explosive attack on the Eclipse, the posh Las Vegas casino co-owned by former CSI Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger). This news-making calamity has Catherine, now working for the FBI in Los Angeles, returning to Sin City to lead the forensics investigation. She'll be joined by her old boss, Gil Grissom (William Petersen), who is back to help with the case because he, too, has a personal connection: One of the prime suspects is his former dominatrix love, Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke).

"It's a privilege to be able to bring real closure to this show -- something that rarely happens when a program gets canceled," says creator Anthony Zuiker, who was making eight bucks an hour as a Vegas tram driver when he sold his <em>CSI</em> pilot to CBS. "Our finale is scary and thrilling and entertaining as hell, but it's also a chance to thank the fans for their undying devotion," Zuiker says. "We want them to feel good about what happens to this family of <em>CSI</em> characters when the show is over. To do that, we've pulled out all the stops."

But first Zuiker took to social media to find out exactly what those loyal fans hoped to see resolved before <em>CSI</em> ends. No surprise there: They rapidly want divorc√©es Gil and Sara (Jorja Fox) to get back together. "Can we please everybody with this finale? Of course not," Zuiker teases. "But will we please most of the people and give them the emotional experience they want? Absolutely."</blockquote>
