In 2010, I got to meet Jorja AND some of you guys, as well as catch some great <em>CSI</em> episodes for Jorja and see her work outside the show get some more attention.  We raised a lot of money and awareness for charity and other worthy causes.  I think, as much as 2010 has been an economic and political trial, with horrifying natural disasters, there's hope, and I see it in all of you.

I'm not inclined to make resolutions in my life at a specific point in time.  When I feel I need a change, I do it.  So I can't tell you what I plan to do yet, since I don't know.  But I can tell you I plan to be here, updating the site and spreading the good word.  Of course, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/jorjas-resolutions-for-2011">Jorja has a resolution</a>

Thank you all, and have a happy, fun and SAFE New Year.  Chime in with your <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/best-moment-of-2010/">Best Jorja Moments of 2010</a>, and please, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/dont-be-a-creepy-fan/">Don't Be a Creepy Fan</a>.

<h3>CSI</h3>
<div class="alignright">[polldaddy poll=4277686]</div>
We only get one episode this month, and next month we'll start out right with <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/csi-11x11-man-up-press-release/">"Man Up"</a>, followed by <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/no-sara-in-a-kiss-before-frying/">"A Kiss Before Frying"</a> (with Dita Von Teese but possibly no Jorja) and then ... <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/marlee-matlin-cast-for-the-two-mrs-grissoms/">"The Two Mrs. Grissoms" (with Marlee Matlin and Phyllis Freilich)</a> which just boggles everyone's mind, I know!  Marlee Matlin even posted <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/jorja-and-marlee-on-set/">a picture of her and Jorja</a> and dished about <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/names-and-sign-language/">Sara's sign language skills</a>. Also, we get Jorja for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/more-than-11/">more than eleven episodes</a>. Yay!  Oh, and this random <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/behind-the-scenes-some-ep/"> behind the scenes photo</a> too.

You may also want to pick up <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/jorja-in-ew-jan-7/">the Jan. 7th issue of EW</a> for a picture of Jorja and ... news you've already read here. Sorry about that!

**CSI Episodes**
&bull; December 9th, "418/427" (<em>3 stars</em>) | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/418/427">Recap</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season11/418427/">Screencaps</a> | <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/csi-11x10-418-427/">Discussion Post</a>

By the way, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/csi-moves-to-usa/"><em>CSI</em> reruns will be airing on USA Network now, as well as Spike</a>.

<h3>Jorja Fox: Producer</h3>
**Dusty Springfield**
We managed to raise enough money to get <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/dusty-springfield-sings-on/">Dusty Springfield a Backer Audition</a>!  On December 11th, they had Broadway backers show up and performed parts of the show-to-be for them.

**How I Became An Elephant**
Jorja was in attendance at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/premiere-of-how-i-became-an-elephant-photos/">December 2nd premiere</a>, which sold out and had to be re-booked.  Wow!  While she was there, there were some <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/premiere-of-how-i-became-an-elephant-photos/">photos taken</a> (and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/more-hibae-photos/">more photos...</a>) and a brief <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/how-i-became-an-elephant-aaron-sanchez-interview/">interview</a>.

<h3>Fundraiser</h3>
This winter, I'm raising money for Animal Acres.  The early goal was $500, but we surpassed that!  So I moved the goal posts.  Think we can make $750 by January 15th?  As incentive for you, I'm offering to post a new bit of Missing Persons media every time a new person donates! (This is to stop some smart aleck from donating $1 six days in a row... )  Since there's a bit of a run of lawyers shutting down sites posting videos, however, I am **unable** to post any Missing Persons videos. Which ... sucks. They're sending out cease and desist orders.

The <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010-fundraiser-for-animal-acres/">2010 Fundraiser for Animal Acres</a> has brought us the following rewards:
&bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/incentive-12-and-13-missing-persons-i-cant-even-imagine/"><del>Video Clips and</del> screencaps for Episode 01x04</a>
&bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/incentive-termite-screencaps/">The Man's an Emotional Termite screencaps</a>

Donations are open until January 15th!

<h3>Tumblr!</h3>
After people asking me over and over 'Why don't you use Tumblr?' I finally came up with a reason to use it!  LOL Jorja's!

<a href="http://jorjafoxonline.tumblr.com/">http://jorjafoxonline.tumblr.com/</a> is up and running and anyone can submit a post with LOL-style captioned Jorja pictures.  I tossed a couple up there, and the rest is up to you.  I'm really a raw novice at Tumblr, so I apologize in advance for getting techy things wrong.  I <em>did</em> set up comments (which don't require you to have a Tumblr account), but if you want to do photo replies and all that, you will need an account, and we need to all be 'friends.'  Which is silly, but that's them.

<h3>No More YouTube</h3>
YouTube closed JFO's channel because of copyvio, which included not just the <em>CSI</em> videos (CBS is cracking down) but also the <em>Missing Persons</em> ones.  Please DO NOT attack or otherwise anger CBS, ABC and everyone else who actually owns the rights.  The situation is this.  While JFO was only posting clips, which are permitted most of the time, other fan sites posted whole episodes.  That meant CBS had to go whole hog and shut down <em>everyone</em>.  I have a very polite email about it from the people at CBS, and right now it means I cannot host ANY <em>CSI</em> videos.  Will this change?  Probably not any time soon.  So if you miss the episode on TV, watch it on CBS.com.  I also cannot publicly tell you the names of sites that could help you download shows illegally.  But I can tell you about a site called <a href="http://www.seriesly.com/">Seriesly</a>, that helps you keep track of shows and when they air.  Don't post links to illegal downloads (like Torrents or other video sites), though. That'll get me in trouble.
