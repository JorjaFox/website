Yeah, everyone at home said '90210 day?  Really?'

<blockquote>HSUS President and CEO Wayne Pacelle will present special awards that night to [_The Big Bang Theory_ actress Kaley] Cuoco as well as _Hot in Cleveland_ star Wendi Malick, and _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_â€™s Jorja Fox for their work on behalf of animals.</blockquote>
