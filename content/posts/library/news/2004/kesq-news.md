The executive producer of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" says he's "very saddened and deeply disappointed" over the firing of two stars on the show.

Williams Petersen issued the statement today after Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes on the show, were fired.

KCBS-TV and Variety reported they were fired after asking for more money to stay on the show.

Petersen, who also stars in the show, says he hopes "cooler heads will prevail and everything will be rectified and restored in due course."

Eads didn't show up for work yesterday, the first day of production for the next season.

The two were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts.

According to reports, a search was underway for their replacements but it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones.

The show picked up four Emmy nominations yesterday, including one for best drama series.
