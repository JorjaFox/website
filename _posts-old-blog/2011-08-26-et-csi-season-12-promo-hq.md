The only problem with <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/et-first-look-at-db/">last night's video</a> was the quality.  So thanks to the magic of TiVo, Toast and Quicktime, we have this higher quality version.  I'm still getting the hang of how it all works, so I'll probably get better at making HQ videos.  It would help if ET aired in HD, of course.

As you can see, Sara had no lines at all, and we only catch glimpses of her with her camera.  What we <em>do</em> get is Nick being snippy, Catherine being petty and DB being kind of like Grissom lite.  Which is okay.  I'd rather have the science, personally!
