"It blows up our whole theory!"  Sara and Nick rev it up on the race track for tonight's episode of _CSI_.  Discuss the episode here. Spoilers will happen and, as always, I'll update once the ep airs and we have caps etc.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
The case of two high school students, one dead and one missing, lead the CSIs into the underbelly of streetcar racing and a tangled web of deadly competition.

This was a fun episode, enjoyable, not super-predictable, and with a nice amount of Sara.  Four Stars.  I'll work on clips tomorrow, so if you have suggestions, post them in the comments and I'll see what I can do.
