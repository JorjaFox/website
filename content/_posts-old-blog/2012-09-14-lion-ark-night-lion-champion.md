So if you're going to be in the LA area on October 13th, Jorja's getting an award! To quote ADI:
<blockquote><strong>Join Bob Barker, Jorja Fox and Animal Defenders International in the Hollywood Hills on October 13 for a night to roar your support for ADI undercover investigations, the fight for new animal protection laws and to celebrate freedom for those animals who got away.</strong>

This special night will feature the presentation of a lifetime achievement award for TV host and philanthropist Bob Barker, the 2012 recipient of the international Lord Houghton Award for Services to Animal Welfare.

And we will be honoring actress Jorja Fox (CSI’s Sarah Sidle) with the ADI Animal Champion Award for her dedicated animal protection work, especially on the suffering of animals used for entertainment.</blockquote>
<a href="http://lionarknight.eventbrite.com/">Buy Tickets Now</a> or read about <a href="http://adievents.com">ADI Events</a>.

It's $100 for the general reception, and $500 for the VIP.

Me? I'll still be in Chicago till the 15th of that month.
