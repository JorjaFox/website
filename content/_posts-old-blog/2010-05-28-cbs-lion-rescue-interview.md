CBS5 interviewed Jorja at the airport last night.  Sadly it's non-embeddable.

<blockquote>[...]

<strong>Don Knapp:</strong> And along for the trip tonight was Jorja Fox, of <em>CSI</em>, she's lending her celebrity and her back.

[...]

<strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I know I am, I'm sure all of us are very concerned about everything that's going on in the gulf.  The news is so bad, so devastating, and this is just a very small moment where we can look at ourselves as people and say, "You know, we're doing something good."

[...]</blockquote>

As a followup, as I type this, Jorja's on-site as the lions are about to be let out into their new home.
