## Synopsis

Grissom and Catherine investigate the murder of a despised comic who died on stage, apparently after drinking from a tainted bottle of water. The case grows more puzzling when a 15-year-old boy dies in a convenience store after drinking the same brand of water.

Also: Brass reopens a woman's accidental-death case after spotting the deceased's husband in a flashy new car with a trophy date on his arm.

## Notes

* Sara gets a big kick out of setting off the car alarm in order to get the husband to let them in.
* Sara's stubbornness is once again displayed when she refuses to quit trying to tear the towel bar off the wall.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Do you want to go to the bathroom?

**Nick:** Yeah, but you're taller, thinner.
**Sara:** Ohh, butter that toast, Nick.
