This is a movie Jorja helped produce (yay!)

"Extinction Soup" is a documentary feature film that exposes the mass slaughter of sharks for their fins and the movement to stop it. You can follow it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/extinctionsoup">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtinctionSoup">Twitter</a>. I've included the video below, but be prepared, it's a bit dark and there's blood.
