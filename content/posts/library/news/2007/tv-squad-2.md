The day finally arrived: "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" fans finally know if Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, survived or not. Last year's finale had the CSI team not only continue their search for the "Miniature Killer" but also for Sara, who became the killer's last victim. There was a lot of speculation over the summer surrounding Sara's fate especially since the show was doing its best to keep it a secret (fans were told they would at least see Sara under the car in the premiere but didn't say more).

Back in April, we learn that "CSI" was planning to kill off a main character and in the following weeks, Sara's name started to pop. Jorja Fox was not a happy camper, even refusing to show up for work at one point. This summer, the show hired an actress to play a new lab tech, which had fans think that it was done for Sara and that the new character was her replacement.

Last night, it was revealed that Sara Sidle lived. The character put up a fight and beat the odds. It was a fantastic episode filled with twists and turns. I've taken the time to read a few reviews before I wrote this post and it seems most "CSI" fans were on the edge of their seats throughout the episode, thought the acting was stellar, and are happy that Sara survived.

Sara may have survived but "TV Guide's" Michael Ausiello reveals that the actress did not come to terms with the show contract-wise and will be departing "CSI" later this fall. Minutes after the premiere aired, Ausiello posted an interesting interview with Jorja Fox in which the actress doesn't want to confirm if she will be departing or not (there is a clause in her contract preventing her from giving spoilers). The interview is worth the read, especially if you are a "CSI" fan.
