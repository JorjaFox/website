In this post-Jericho era, any network executive or TV producer who's just signed off on a potentially unpopular change now expects to spend their next day at the office buried underneath an avalanche of foodstuffs delivered by protesting viewers who now believe that even the most stubborn of minds can be changed with a metric ton of peanuts. Discussing the announcement of Jorja Fox's (officially voluntary) departure from CSI with TVGuide.com, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn marvels at how disappointed fans have escalated things since the now quaint-seeming NUTS to CBS! campaign:

Reinforcing the story that leaving was Fox's decision alone and that the producers were powerless to stop their beloved star from following her creative muse is a savvy move; perhaps the misguided fans will take the hint and direct their next act of devotion towards the actress instead of the show's staff, like hiring a plane trailing a "JORJA! GO BACK TO CSI! WE LOVE YOU BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE THIS IS THE BEST GIG YOU'LL EVER HAVE!" banner* to circle her house until she realizes the terrible career miscalculation she's just made.
