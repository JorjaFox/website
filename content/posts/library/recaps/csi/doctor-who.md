## Synopsis

Heidi Custer, a reporter from New York, is found dead, a body dump. Surveillance footage shows she met with Langston at a hotel. Her husband accuses Langston of being a murderer, claiming his wife determined Langston was involved with 'Angel of Death' from a hospital in Delaware. Langston is kicked off the case, due to conflict of interests, and thinks that Heidi was following him and got killed for it. Langston continues to investigate, making the CSIs aware on to his clandestine behavior, as he's late to other crime scenes. Catching him at it, Catherine suspends him.

Nick comes over to Langston's house and finds his wall of weird, dedicated to Jekyll. Even though Nick has suspicions of Langston's involvement. Shortly after Langston and Nick agree to team up, Sara and Greg come over to help as well. The whole team follows Langston's leads and determine Heidi's death wasn't related to Jekyll, at least not directly. She was killed by a punk who wanted money for information on Jekyll.

However. Jekyll has been trailing Langston. And the serial killer Grissom and Langston put behind bars, Nate Haskell, claims to know who Jekyll is.

## Review

Sara and Greg find the body of Heidi Custer, and Sara finds the first evidence, linking her to Langston, and later find the car used to transport the body.

## Notes

* Sara is still vague with most of her coworkers about her personal past.

## Quotes

**Sara:** I understand not wanting to share the details of your personal life with your coworkers.... But you don't share the fruits of your investigative works...?
