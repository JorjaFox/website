<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/pub/s10/1002-ghosttown01.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/08/1002-ghosttown-100x100.jpg" alt="1002-ghosttown" title="1002-ghosttown" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1934" /></a> I know it's hit the world already and some folks are thinking 'That spoiler can't be true.' They read the news and thought that the mystery source was a hoax. I'm here to verify that the source this spoiler comes from is indeed reliable.

Grissom and Sara are indeed married.

It also looks like Sara's in Episode 10x02, unless they're filming all out of order again.
