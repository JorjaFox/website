This is the episode with George's wife, Monica. Jorja told us "I got to work with George's wife's dead body." and my wife remarked "Well that's awkward." My wife is great at the deadpan replies. Of course when I said that I knew it was the episode with the people in cement, Jorja teased me for knowing all that. It's not my fault! CBS released those photos!
