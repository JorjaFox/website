Back in High School, Jorja was in a play called "Pillow Talk" and it certainly looks like her!  And it looks like the play (I've seen the Doris Day version on film).

Says the poster:
<blockquote>The kiss scene from the stage play 'Pillow Talk' performed by CSI's Jorja Fox and Christopher Plotts (me) in 1984 at Melbourne High School. I have greatly cleaned up the audio and picture from the original videotape. Its what I do at <a title="http://www.special-orders.com" dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.special-orders.com/" target="_blank">http://www.special-orders.com</a> I may consider producing a DVD for sale of the whole show if I get enough interest.</blockquote>

I say everyone should comment on that page and get the DVD made!

Pillow Talk was mentioned in a June 2003 issue of Florida Today, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Florida_Today_(11_June_2003)">'CSI'  star's come a long way since her school days in Brevard</a>
<blockquote>In several magazine articles supplied by a Los Angeles publicity agency, Fox stated that anger was one her easiest emotions to access for a role. Indeed, when she attended Mel-Hi, her attitude caught the attention of English and drama teacher Leslie Gabe. Gabe went on to cast Fox in two starkly contrasting productions: the romantic comedy "Pillow Talk" and "Juvie," a bleak drama about life in a juvenile detention center.

" 'Pillow Talk' didn't seem like a natural fit for her," says Gabe, who worked Fox into the lead character played by Doris Day in the 1959 film. "The only other role she'd played was in 'Juvie,' and the lead was a girl who was dark and angry. That was the persona Jorjan liked to project until you got to know her better. She had an aura about her, a little bit of a wall that kept people at a distance."</blockquote>
