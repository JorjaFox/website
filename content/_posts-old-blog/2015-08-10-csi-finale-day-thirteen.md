There was no day twelve. You didn't miss anything. Of course, if you <em>did</em> miss any images, the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/pub/s16/candid/">CSI Season 16 Candid Gallery</a> has all the images.

## News

We got the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2015/csi-finale-official-description/">finale's synopsis</a>.

> <strong>SERIES FINALE:</strong> In the special two-hour series finale, a catastrophic event paralyzes Las Vegas, and Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass return to help the team with the investigation. Also, D.B. Russell and Sara Sidle make decisions regarding the future of their crime-fighting careers, and Lady Heather returns, creating maniacal controversy between Grissom and Sidle. @CSI_CBS

We knew about Lady Heather, but Sara makes a decision about her future? And 'maniacal' controversy sounds really, really, dramatic.

The Television Critics Awards comes out this time every year. Of course they were asked about CSI.

I sure hope so. Tassler also said it was a billion dollar franchise that changed the face of CBS. That's entirely true.
