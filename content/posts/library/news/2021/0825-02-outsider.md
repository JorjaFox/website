_CSI: Vegas_ is in production and ready to premiere this fall. The show features a lot of the same characters from _CSI_. The iconic show ran from 2000 through 2015 with fifteen action-packed seasons. _CSI: Vegas_ serves as a sequel to the series and picks up where CSI left off. Stars William Peterson and Jorja Fox are both returning to the show. Here’s how they reacted when they first got the call:

According to what the two told TV Insider in an interview about the series, both were hesitant, after all, not all sequels are successes. Not to mention _CSI_ ended on a positive note for both Peterson and Sidle’s characters. But the two felt confidant about working with each other again.

“I was hesitant,” Gil Grissom actor William Peterson told the publication. “But the idea of coming back and doing this with Jorja…”

Jorja Fox, who is reprising her role as Sara Sidle agreed that she was hesitant about returning to _CSI_.

“I was also hesitant—I felt like the story left Sara and Grissom in paradise together—but getting to work with William Petersen again? They had me at hello!” the actress said.

While this is a sequel series to CSI, this won’t be the same old show. There will be plenty of new characters that’ll work alongside the returning ones. Paula Newsome, Mel Rodriguez, Matt Lauria, and Mandeep Dhillon will all join the returning cast for _CSI: Vegas_.

William Peterson Had to Be Rushed to The Hospital From the ‘_CSI: Vegas_’ Set

In a strange and scary turn of events, William Peterson had to be rushed to the hospital while filming for the upcoming sequel series. According to Deadline, the actor asked for a break after feeling exhausted and was rushed to the hospital after not improving.

A publicist for Peterson cited exhaustion from working long hours on the show over the past 12 weeks. According to Entertainment Weekly, the _CSI: Vegas_ star was released from the hospital and is reportedly feeling better. Variety reports that production for the series will last until November barring any unforeseen circumstances.

_CSI: Vegas_ will mark the fifth series in the franchise and will essentially revive a universe people didn’t think they’d encounter again. Other shows in the franchise are _CSI: Miami_, _CSI: NY_, and _CSI: Cyber_. _Cyber_ is the most recent spinoff, premiering in 2015 but quickly getting canceled by CBS in 2016.

There’s not much longer to wait before the premiere of _CSI: Vegas_. The show returns on October 6th at 10/9 Central on CBS. The show was initially delayed for a year due to the pandemic but is now able to film in relative safety. In addition to Peterson and Fox, Wallace Langham (David Hodges), and Paul Gilfoyle (Jim Brass), will also return to the series.
