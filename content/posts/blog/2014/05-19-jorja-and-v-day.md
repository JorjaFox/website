When I sighed that he was the only one taking photos, he said this:

If moreÂ come in, photos will be up at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/stage/20140516-vday/">V-Day Gallery</a> (there's a new stage section! yay!). It doesn't look like this was attended by too many photogs, so there's nothing on the major image sites that I've found. Sad panda.
