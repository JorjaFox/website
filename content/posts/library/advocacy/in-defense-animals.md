Hi, Jorja Fox here asking you to support this year's International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos. These magnificent, magical creatures are some of the world's smartest and also one of the world's most endangered animals. Yet they have long suffered from man's brutality, including in zoos. Let's evolve beyond zoos. They are arcane, cruel and a tragic waste of an elephant's life. We need to put the focus where it belongs -- on protecting elephants in their natural habitats -- and stop wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on artificial and inadequate zoo displays that will never meet their needs. Instead of cruel confinement and domination, let's offer sanctuary, peace, compassion and hope. The elephants are depending on us, our children our looking to us, and our very own survival as a species depends on it.
