## Synopsis

When Doc Robbins attends a funeral for a friend's daughter, he gets wrapped up in helping determine how Ana Ortiz died. Nick goes with him to a border town in Mexico being torn apart by drug wars. Sadly, Doc Robbins determines the girl suffered symptoms of drug use, but it turns out to be heavy metal poisoning. They find the same trace on Ana as they do on dead drug cartel members, and prove that she was at the same crime scene. They also determine that Ana's body was dumped in Mexico by a shipping company based in Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, back in Las Vegas, Greg and Sara work a case where a couple is buried in concrete in a garage. Luckily for the CSIs, the criminal mistook expansive mortar for concrete which, as the name suggest, expands. The victims are a wife (Claire) and brother in-law (Jeff), both shot through the head. When the husband (Brett's) hair is found at the scene, he becomes the prime suspect. But more surprising is that Claire also suffered from heavy metal poisoning, just like Anna.

Both women were having portraits done by the same artist. Ana's father had hired Keith Garner, Ana's art teacher, to do a portrait of her. Keith was also Claire's art teacher, 15 years ago.

## Quotes

**Sara:** That's one hell of a body dump.
