Next week's Entertainment Weekly has some nice Ausiello scoop that should be music to the ears of any GSR fan.  I'll sum it up with a quote from executive producer Naren Shankar: "They're absolutely together."

Okay? You still with me?  Good!  Massive props to **tee** (from YTDAW) for scanning in <a href="http://s45.photobucket.com/albums/f72/teelugo1982/?action=view&current=scan0001.jpg">the following article</a>. For those who can't read the print, here:
<blockquote>**'CSI' Scoop: Sara's back! Will Grissom be next?**

Less that a year after reuniting in the jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox is heading back to _CSI_ this fall -- _alone_.  But don't take Fox's five-episode to mean that Sara and Grissom's happily-ever-after was a bust.  "They're absolutely together," insists executive producer, Naren Shankar, who nonetheless says Sara will drop hints at trouble in paradise.  "We're talking about a couple of very independent individuals who have decided to share their life together.  The first few months of that for any couple are a weird adjustment."

So, if it's not a breakup, what _does_ prompt Sara to revisit the Vegas strip?  Shankar and fellow executive producer Carol Mendelsohn maintain it was not a mandate from CBS to stem last season's rating slide.  That said, the pair concede that the back-to-back-to-back departures of Fox, Gary Dourdan and Petersen, combined with the arrivals of Laurence Fisburne and Lauren Lee Smith, took a toll.  "The family had disintegrated a little bit," Shankar says. "We had people off in their own bubbles, and we want to restore that family [feeling]. And Jorja's helping with that."  Adds Mendelsohn: "Sara comes in and brings everyone together.  And she helps Catherine understand that as he [new] leader, she needs to make the team cohesive and really fire on all cylinders again."

Might she get an in-person assist from Petersen? "You never know when Grissom will show up on _CSI_," teases Mendelsohn.  "The theme of [season 10] is family.  And he certainly is a big part of the family -- a _big_ part of the family."  I'll that that as a yes.</blockquote>

I did mention spoilers, right?  Well, here's spoiler tv with some info on episode <a href="http://spoilertv-csi.blogspot.com/2009/07/csi-las-vegas-episode-1001-ghost-town.html"><del datetime="2009-07-24T20:05:39+00:00">10.01</del> 10.02 Ghost Town</a>.  <del datetime="2009-07-24T20:05:39+00:00">Which may mean a re-write or a re-jiggering of the already presumed episode 1, Family Affair.</del> Or a correction that this is ep 10.02. Heh!
