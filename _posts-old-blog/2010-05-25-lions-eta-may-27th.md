<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/05/lionrescue.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/05/lionrescue-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="lionrescue" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2437" /></a> The former circus lions will make their way from Bolivia this week and will land in San Francisco International Airport at 3:30pm US Pacific time.  If you're in San Francisco, don't bother going, as this will be a 'media only' event.  And besides, I know <em>I'm</em> cranky after a long flight.  Imagine the lions!

Broadcast video and photographs of the lions with the circus as well as the rescue operation in Bolivia are available via <a href="http://adinternationalmedia.org/">http://adinternationalmedia.org/</a>

<blockquote>Four lions rescued by Animal Defenders International (ADI) following the groundbreaking 2009 ban on Bolivian circus animals are scheduled to arrive at San Francisco International Airport via TAB Airlines on Thursday, May 27, 2010 at approximately 3:30 p.m. PDT. The lions will then travel to the ARK2000 sanctuary in San Andreas, California, run by the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) where they will be released into a wonderful new natural habitat the following day. The lions, first to be saved as a result of the ban, have lived their lives in a rusting cage on the back of a truck. They will be touching down in paradise, where for the first time they will feel the grass beneath their paws and have freedom to roam as they choose. CSI actress Jorja Fox will be participating in the rescue operation which was funded by TV personality Bob Barker. Fox and other ADI personnel are available to brief media about the operation and journey from Bolivia in advance of the arrival. Spanish spokespersons are also available.</blockquote>
