It kind of looks like George was talking without really thinking about how he said what he said.  Implying that there were 'grumblings' behind William Petersen's departure and tension with Gary Dourdan and Jorja Fox when they left is par for the course.  When someone wants to leave a job, they usually aren't the most fun to be around because they're ready to be gone, after all.

But then he dropped this bombshell:

> I miss Jorja, but having [Lauren Lee Smith] here, not being a diva, not being insecure, just doing a good job and being a really sweet person â€¦ We're lucky to have [her].

Clearly a lot of this is open to interpenetration, but questions **5, 6, 8 and 9** are fairly eye-brow raising.  Read the whole article at aol.com and form your own opinions: [14 Questions With: George Eads](http://television.aol.com/insidetv/2009/03/03/14-questions-with-george-eads)
