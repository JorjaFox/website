In the ongoing effort to fight spam, I'm trying to sort out which accounts are real people and which are spammers.  Since you don't have to register here to comment on the blog, the only reason you might have is to comment on the forums or to protect your identity here.  So a purge has begun.  Accounts here that don't meet at least ONE of the following criteria have been deleted:

<ol>
	<li>Have at least one comment in the blog and/or forum post</li>
	<li>Have a custom Gravatar</li>
	<li>Have provided a 'name'</li>
	<li>Have provided a non-spam URL</li>
	<li>Have talked to me at least once</li>
</ol>

What does that mean?  Well 50% of you have fulfilled at least one of those! I went through each account on the forums, to double check.  As for the 'talked to me' requirement, some of you I know are real people because we've chatted in email.  

If I've deleted a 'real' ID, you can make a new one, but before you do, think about this: Do you plan on using the forums or commenting a lot? If not, you really don't need to bother!  Seriously, anonymous comments are allowed, just so you don't have to mess around with making an ID and having to remember all that.

I have a list of all 67 IDs that were deleted, so I'll keep an eye out for you again.
