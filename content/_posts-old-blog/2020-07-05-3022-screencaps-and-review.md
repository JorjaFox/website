<p>It took me far longer than I wanted, but I've finally gotten screenshots and a full review for <em>3022</em>.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/3022/">Review</a> - ★★★☆☆  (3 out of 5)</li><li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/movies/3022/screencaps/">Screenshots</a> - 138</li></ul>

<p>So. What can I tell you about the movie?</p>

<p>First and foremorest, Jorja shows up about halfway through and she dies before it's 3/4ths over. So please level-set your hopes there. The movie is exactly as I'd expected. What happens to people in outer space when the Earth is destroyed?</p>

<p>Like a lot of people, movies like <em>Event Horizon</em> absolutely messed me up with space movies when people go crazy. They are terrifying. This movie? Not terrifying, but very captivating. If you've seen <em>Gravity</em> it's more like that then a terror/horror movie.</p>

<p>I found <em>3022</em> enjoyable and worth the watch. If this shows up on your streamers, I would recommend it even were it not for Jorja. As a movie to watch specifically <em>for</em> Jorja? It's 3 stars out of 5. She portrays someone who actually saw the end of the world, and it's with a subtlety that she delivers Diane's obvious PTSD. That kind of acting is why I love watching her work. You know how broken the character is, and she lets it out one small piece at a time. If she had more scenes (or didn't die) I would easily give this four stars.</p>

<p>Some death trivia!</p>

<ul><li>This is Jorja's second space movie (the first being <em><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/velocity-trap/">Velocity Trap</a></em>)</li><li>Jorja's characters have died in 100% of the space-themed movies she's been in</li><li>Counting TV movies, she's died in 4 out of 16 movies (25%)</li></ul>

<p>Have you seen <em>3022</em>? Let me know what you think!</p>
