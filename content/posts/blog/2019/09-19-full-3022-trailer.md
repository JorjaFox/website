The full trailer for _[3022](https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/3022/)_ is out and it's a doozy.

{{< youtube kw_XutG4KkM >}}

This reminds me of _Event Horizon_ which was a movie that absolutely gave me nightmares. Creepy and psychological, we get a look into what happens when we realize there will be no happy ending.

Jorja is in the first half of the trailer, using an accent I've not heard from her before and I'm excited for that.

What do you think _3022_ will be like?
