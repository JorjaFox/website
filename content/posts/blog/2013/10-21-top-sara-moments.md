This took a while to sort out because ... Well you'll see. I picked out one Sara moment per season, the one that stood out the most. Some seasons were hard to find one (like season <del>three</del> four, surprisingly, not a single 5 star episode!) and others (season <del>four</del> five) made it hard to pick only one.

Oh ... There's a sequel to this post tomorrow.
