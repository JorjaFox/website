Look, I've seen pretty much every non-manip'd picture of Jorja there is on this planet, and this one just looks <em>weird</em>. Something's not right.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/pub/s12/stills/0004-jorja.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4130" title="Cast Promo" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/12/cast-promo-230x153.jpg" alt="Cast Promo" width="230" height="153" /></a>

See what I mean? Click to see the full sized, just as odd looking, photo.
