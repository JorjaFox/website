**CSI: Pasadena** Since I took the liberty of skipping the CBS Digital Media Presentation (sorry; just say the word "multiplatform" to yourself about 75 times, and I swear it'll be just like you were there), the last session of the day was for Television's No. 1 Drama. I don't watch this program (because I figure enough people do), so I'm not sure what sorts of significant things were said. Jorja Fox is happy that her character, Sara, kissed William Petersen's character, Grissom. And that's the biggest thing that happened last season, right? Other questions addressed this fall's competition with the show's new time-slot buddy Grey's Anatomy. For some reason, the word "underdog" keeps getting tossed around. Yeah, right, CSI. You're so scrappy. Perspective is a funny thing. Other info (spoiler!): The season premiere will involve a crime that takes place backstage at Cirque du Soleil, and Marg Helgenberger's character will be slipped a mickey. A reporter found a way to work Joan of Arcadia into his question, which is only funny if you were at a certain panel on CBS Day One (and even then, it's not that funny).
