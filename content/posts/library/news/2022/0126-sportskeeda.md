Jorja Fox, a veteran of the  _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ franchise, confirmed that she will not be returning to her role as Sara Sidle in season 2.

On Tuesday, she took to Twitter to announce her departure from the show. She wrote,

{{< blockquote >}}
Hey all you #CSI fans! After much deliberating, I have decided not to 'Sidle up' for CSI Vegas. For me, CSI has always been a love story. The story that people can find love in the darkest of places and times. And the story that love, even in the darkest of places and times, can expand and grow roots and endure. I personally just can't split Sara and Grissom up again. So goes Grissomâ€¦..So goes Sara. Wherever they go, they belong together.

The revival, which reunited Fox with William Petersen, her longtime co-star in the original _CSI_ franchise, has already received a second season order from CBS. Paula Newsom, Matt Lauria, Mandeep Dhillon, and Mel Rodriguez portrayed a fresh new _CSI_ squad on the show. Although Petersen will not feature in season 2, he will continue to serve as an executive producer.

Let's go through the lifetime achievements of Fox, the former _CSI Vegas_ actor who has dedicated many years of her life to flawlessly playing the part.

## Who is Jorja Fox? The net worth of the CSI: Vegas actress explored.

Jorja Fox is an actress, musician, and songwriter from the United States with a net worth of $6 million.

She first gained fame as a recurring guest star on the television medical drama _ER_, where she played Dr. Maggie Doyle on several occasions.

Following that, she had a successful recurring role on _The West Wing_ as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano. She was a regular and recurring cast member on the police procedural drama _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ from 2000 to present day.

Fox co-founded Honeypot Productions, a Los Angeles-based independent avant-garde theater company that has presented five original dramas. She also has the brand Matt & Nat to her name.

Apart from being an actress, Fox is also a drummer and guitarist. She sings and has created songs such as _Lullabye_, which she composed for the film _Traveling Companion_, and _Satellite_.

## Her role in CSI: Vegas

_CSI: Vegas_ began with a storyline about a problem with the crime lab that could result in the release of thousands of convicted killers.

William Petersen portrayed Gil Grissom, a prominent character on the show for the first nine seasons and a recurring character in several subsequent seasons.

His character was romantically involved with Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox. She was a main cast member for the first eight seasons before becoming a recurring character in later seasons.

Their characters got married later in the series, even though their rocky relationship on the show resulted in a divorce.
