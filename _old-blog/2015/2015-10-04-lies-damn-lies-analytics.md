It's all over.

_CSI_ is at least.

Since December 2008, JFO has been using Google Analytics to measure traffic.  Google uses multiple metrics, and tracks every single page on the site (wiki, gallery,blog, etc). When there was a forum, it tracked that too. Since August, 2011, WordPress.com stats have been running. It only measures the blog itself, so the numbers are vastly different.

By comparing things and running various checks, I was able to sort something out. Here are the top three _CSI_ days:
<ul>
	<li>**Most Page Views:** "Dead Doll", "Immortality", "Forget Me Not"</li>
	<li>**Most Sessions:** "Immortality", "Forget Me Not", "Dead Doll"</li>
	<li>**Busiest Day: **"Immortality", "Forget Me Not", "Dead Doll"</li>
</ul>
Page views is just 'How many pages were viewed.' Sessions is interesting, as that's the number of 'users' who do something on the site - so how many people. There's also 'users' but those numbers are very close to sessions for JFO. Busiest is a combination of the two, and would be the one that had the most sessions and pageviews.

Sessions blows my mind. "Immortality" is double the sessions of "Forget Me Not." Double. I'm surprised the server only slowed to a crawl and didn't actually crash. Oh yes, it was so slow as to be read-only on Sunday night. It was 'unavailable' a couple times (even for me) but the server never actually crashed like it used to.

I think "Dead Doll" was so many page views because right after it aired, Jorja announced she was leaving the show. Also fourth place for _all_ of those would be Marg's last episode.

In retrospect, it's odd to be part of a critical darling like _CSI_. Most of the shows I watch and like are low-ratings, weird things. They get canceled after one season, if that. Many don't make it to the first break. Most aren't even American. But then there was _CSI_, and I had to deal with not just a popular US show but the people who were fans of those things. I'd not really been a part of that before. Not like this.

It's been a great, wild, weird, fifteen. I've made some amazing friends I plan to keep. _CSI_ helped propel me to a career I love.

For this site, expect nothing to change except no weekly posts about a crime show. When Jorja does advocacy work, or is on the red carpet, or is guesting on a show, it'll be posted here. If you don't want to visit every day (and I totally get that), there's a mailing list that will drop you an email for every new post.
