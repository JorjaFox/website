CBS has announced their new premiere week:
<blockquote><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10985" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/06/4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249.png" alt="CBS Shows" width="600" height="377" />

**PREMIERE WEEK**

[...]

Sunday, Sept. 28: CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION debuts in its new time period (10:00-11:00 PM).</blockquote>
Get ready! They're planning to do all 22 in a row, no breaks, except probably for basketball/football/awards. So expect episode 2 (which they're filming now) to be aired October 5th.
