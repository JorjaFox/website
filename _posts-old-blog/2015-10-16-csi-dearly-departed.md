<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/lisa-egan/csi-show_b_8307652.html">Why the Dearly Departed CSI Was the Show I Waited for My Whole Life</a> by Lisa Egan
<blockquote>I know it's only been two weeks, but I miss _CSI_ already.

I didn't watch the show when it initially began, it was one of those things that passed me by. But about 2006 I was at a loose end for which DVD box set to rent next from LoveFilm. I thought "I hear _CSI_ is pretty good. It's got the really beautiful brunette with the amazing eyes from _ER_ and _The West Wing_. I'll give it a go."

I was instantly hooked. The storytelling, the technology, the intelligence of it; It was just wonderful.
<div id="modulous_mid_article" class="ad_spot">But then in episode six a new character turned up and I saw someone just like me on TV for the first time in my life. I was 27 years old and I'd never seen myself reflected on TV before.</div>
Sure, Doc Robbins wasn't **exactly** like me. He was 30 years older than me, male, and heterosexual. But it was the first time I had ever seen a realistic disabled character on TV.</blockquote>
It's important to remember the other ways in which <em>CSI</em> changed the world. We all started watching because we knew a certain brunette. We kept watching for a lot of other reasons.
