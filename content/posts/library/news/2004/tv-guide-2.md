**ALARM CLOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE:** Fired *CSI* actor **George Eads** claims he missed work last week because he simply overslept. "They think it's about money and it's not," Eads told reporters at the TCA press tour in L.A., where he was promoting TNT's *Evel Knievel* film. "I overslept. I woke up white as a sheet three-and-a-half hours after I was supposed to be on the set." Eads adds that he called *CSI* to say he'd be coming in late, and was told "Don't bother." Echoing the fateful words of CBS chief **Les Moonves**, the 37-year-old said "a contract is a contract," insisting he wasn't holding out for a raise of his $100,000-per-episode salary. "Let me tell you, I've apologized nine ways to Sunday," he said. "It's a big misunderstanding, straight up. I want all this to work out. *CSI* is a part of who I am." No word yet from his fellow prodigal thespian, **Jorja Fox**, who was last seen shining Les Moonves' shoes with *CSI: New York*'s **Carmine Giovinazzo**.
