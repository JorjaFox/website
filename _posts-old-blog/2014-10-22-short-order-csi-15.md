Don't panic!

First, _CSI_ was going to have 22 episodes and then 20 and now it's 18.  But. It apparently has _nothing_ to do with ratings. From the oft lamented (by me at least) Michael Ausiello, the decision was made due to time-slot inventory. We already knew that _CSI: Cyber_ was going to air in the same time-slot after _CSI_ was done, but CBS also has _Battle Creek_ and a 7th season of _The Mentalist_ out there and they're all in line.
<blockquote>_CSI’_s move to Sundays at 10/9c has produced decent results: Although the show is down double-digits from its Season 14 average (when it aired Wednesdays at 10), it’s maintaining the time period’s year-ago average in viewers and adults 18-49.

This marks the first time in _CSI_‘s 15 year history that it will produce less than a full-season’s worth of episodes.</blockquote>

I don't think that it's factual that Season 15 is the only short order, but the last time it happened was the writer's strike so I don't know if the 17 episode season 8 counts or not.
