Jorja Fox, who plays intern Maggie Doyle on *ER*, is going to keep her job even as she moves to a hospital on the UPN network. She will still be a medical intern on *The True Story*, a drama series being considered by UPN for its fall lineup. However, Fox will be the star instead of an *ER* bit player; her character's father is in jail for killing her mother.

If that series doesn't sound unusual enough, consider two other programs UPN may greenlight: *Student Affairs*, a spoof of daytime soaps set in college, and *Secret Agent Man*, which is loosely based on the '60 series *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.*
