TV Equals' CSI recap has always been pro-GSR, but this week the question came up of "Why is the Hodges-Elisabetta-Morgan triangle less gripping than the Grissom-Sara-Heather one of yor?"
<blockquote>Now, down to business. Why are we still being asked to care about the Hodges-Elisabetta-Morgan pseudo-triangle? If the characters themselves don’t seem to care, as Morgan’s blank face and willingness to encourage the Italian broad would seem to imply, why should we? Remember the good old days when people were so invested in Grissom and Sara and Lady Heather that they created fan fiction and letter campaigns and websites? There is one Tumblr site for “Modges” and it has fifteen items. In big text at the bottom it said “Sorry, we couldn’t find anymore posts.” I think that speaks for itself.

It’s been suggested that the crop of writers in charge of the show these days are trying to distance themselves from anything they consider “old school” (ie: Nick, Sara, Greg and Brass), and that CSI more closely resembles a spin-off than a continuation of itself. As much as I want to rally behind what was once my favorite show, I can’t construct an argument against that. Unless you’re just one of those Sara-haters (and your existence proves that CSI–and Jorja Fox–did something right by creating a character that you care about enough to hate), can you think of any reason to massacre Sara and Grissom’s marriage, a plotline that took up approximately 0.000001% of the show? Can you justify why there needs to be an Elisabetta at all, when a much more compelling (albeit soap-operish) triangle could have been created with Greg? Can you tell me why the most interesting relationship Nick has had since season one has been with a German Shepherd? And why does Brass have more of a cameo these days than an active role?</blockquote>
I don't have an answer, but I guess I can't be to terribly surprised that CSI had it's lowest ratings _ever_ this week. Why am I not surprised? I never saw a single ad. No tweets, no activity. The social push for this episode was so low, I almost forgot there was an episode on!
