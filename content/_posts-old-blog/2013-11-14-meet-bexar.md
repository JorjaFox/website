Jorja's beloved boxer, Ali, passed away. I didn't report on it at the time because ... well I don't report on stuff until Jorja makes it public! Then when Jorja was in Texas, she found a dog.

Bexar, pronounced 'Bear', is a total scruffy mutt. Part poodle, no doubt, but none of that matters.
<blockquote>"When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of 14 years," she reveals in an interview with Sweden with Love. Bexar (pronounded "bear") had been found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas, but it wasn't exactly love at first sight.

"I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit and she did the same to me â€¦ Then all of a sudden, it flipped, and now I'm completely in love with her," Fox admits. "She's the coolest, little scruffy dog I ever knew."</blockquote>

Hey if that's what it takes to get Jorja on the front of People.com, I'll take it. Bexar is adorable and looks very cuddly! You can see more pictures from this photo shoot in the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/media/online/20131113-swedenwithlove/">Sweden with Love Gallery</a>.
