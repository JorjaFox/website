From USA Today weekend (which I guess starts on Friday):
<blockquote>_CSI _actress Jorja Fox has made rescuing lions one of her life's missions.

**<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9543" alt="image" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/12/image.jpg" width="187" height="250" />What**: Animal Defenders International (ADI) ambassador

**Why**: 'I've been passionate about habitats, preservation and animals in captivity for a long time," says Fox, who appears in and is an associate producer of the documentary _Lion Ark_. "We're at a very critical time for this work to happen. We can do a lot better by these animals. We all know that."

**When**: _Lion Ark_, which follows 25 lions rescued from illegal traveling circuses across Bolivia through their journey to a sanctuary in Colorado, is now at festival screenings (<a title="http://www.lionarkthemovie.com/screenings/" href="http://www.lionarkthemovie.com/screenings/">lionarkthemovie.com/screenings</a>).

"Most of these lions had never put their paws to grass, yet alone had acres and acres to meander," Fox says. "It's a feel good movie; in many ways, sort of a mission impossible. I knew it was going to be an outstanding amazing thing for these animals. I underestimated what a great human story it was going to be. It really is true, a small group of people can come together and work diligently to make really big changes in something they are passionate about."
