Want to have some fun? Vote for CSI as [Favorite TV Show](http://vote.peopleschoice.com/#!/home/all/27/2). It will have to be a write-in, but you can also write it in for [Favorite Network TV Drama](http://vote.peopleschoice.com/#!/home/all/30/2) and [Favorite TV Crime Drama](http://vote.peopleschoice.com/#!/home/all/35/2).

While you're at it, you should put in Jorja as [Favorite Dramatic TV Actress](http://vote.peopleschoice.com/#!/home/all/32/2) and [Favorite TV Crime Drama Actress](http://vote.peopleschoice.com/#!/home/all/80/2).

Is it just me, or are they getting really nit-picky with those?

While I know that CSI can't win for this TV season, maybe they can get a special award. They deserve it.
