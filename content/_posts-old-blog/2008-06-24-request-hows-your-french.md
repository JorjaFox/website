I have a French magazine with an old interview of Jorja.  Problem is my French to English translation skills are severely lacking.  <s>If you are fluent in both English and French, please email webmaster @ jorjafox.net and I'll send you the article.  I can try to clean up the article if your English isn't tops, but I'm hoping one of you folks is acing French.</s>  :grin:

<em>Edited: After 20 responses and already a few mail backs with article translations, I'll sit down tonight and sort out the best re-reading of the article! Thank you everyone, you're an awesome community!</em>
