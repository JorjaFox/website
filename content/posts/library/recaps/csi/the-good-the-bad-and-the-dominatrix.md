## Synopsis

Lady Heather  is nearly strangled to death, while acting out a Wild West fantasy. Heather claimed to have been at the theme park to arrange for a private party, when the man arrived and strangled her. Later the night guard is found dead as well. When Brass comes to serve Heather with a warrant, Grissom serves as her alibi. Heather had sold her business to raise money to set up a trust fund to put her infant granddaughter, of whom she did not have custody, through college. In the end, it's revealed that Heather was trying to kill herself out of depression.

A fifteen year-old pickpocket and petty thief is found dead of blunt force trauma with paint chips in her hair, from a taxi. Two taxi drivers had been feuding, and the girl was killed accidentally.

## Review

Sara arrives on the scene to help Catherine, and asks Catherine about Lady Heather. Once Catherine gets started, she delves into the details of Lady Heather's career and the relationship she presumes exists between Grissom and Lady Heather. Sara tries multiple times to get Catherine back on a work topic. Sara goes to the hospital to collect Heather's clothes, an SAE kit, and photograph her neck. While she's doing so, Grissom arrives. Grissom spends the night with Lady Heather and provides an alibi for her. Later, when Sara's processing evidence, she and Grissom talk about the case, though there's tension between them. When Grissom tries to explain that he's Heather's only friend and needs to help her, Sara says she understands, but sounds bitter and jealous.

* Sara is visibly upset when Grissom explains that Lady Heather needs him, even though she says that she understands.
