I woke up to $100 donation!  Luckily I made the clip ready to go last night.

Context.  The first episode, no one wants to let Connie out onto the street. She's too young, cute and, duh, a woman.  This was the 90s, after all, people, where we used cell phones bigger than my iPad, and wore tight purple pants, thinking we were cool.  Finally, after struggling for the first hour of the two-hour Pilot, Connie finds a way to get a case of her own, and goes out into the field.  But before she does that, she has to practice the fine art of presenting herself, and her badge.

I have one more good (IMO) clip from this ep, and then we'll go back to some screencaps.
