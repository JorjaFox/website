## Synopsis

Sean Becker, a racist, is found dead by a high school, practicing Cabaret as their musical (with Catherine's daughter, Lindsey as the star Sally Bowles, dead in the storm drain. Sean was not, however drowned, having been stabbed by a Phillip's head screwdriver beforehand. In searching Sean's home, turns out to be a rather well read intellectual.

Nick and Greg find the murder weapon, while Sara and Ray go over the history of injuries found on Sean. Meanwhile, the team talks to everyone Sean had fought with recently, including Laurent Senyabou. Laurent is also the only person sad Sean is dead. Laurent claimed that Sean protected him from some skinheads, Sean's old friends. Over the last few months, Sean had talked to Laurent about the genocide in Rwanda, which Laurent had survived, and became compassionate and understanding. Sean had begun to learn that hatred only begets more hatred. Unfortunately, his girlfriend, also a racist, found out and told his friends. They got into a fight with Sean, and she thinks that they killed Sean, though she didn't see the murder.

The killer was actually Laurent, or rather Matthew Babajide, who was not a victim of the genocide but a perpetrator and a chief architect of some of the more horrific actions. Matthew was attempting to reconcile himself with his past, create a new life, however the War Crimes Tribunal still has a warrant out for his arrest. The CSIs are able to pin Sean's murder on Matthew, who killed him after Sean discovered his true identity.

## Review

Sara and Brass go to deliver notification of Sean's death to his Alzheimer afflicted grandmother (his mother suffered a mental breakdown when her husband left her for another man).

Sara catches Lindsey reviewing the case files and talks to her. Lindsey is sympathetic to Sean's life, and feels bad for not being nicer to him. A few days prior to his death, he'd asked her about AFIS. While Lindsey thinks Sean was hitting on her, Sara wonders why he was interested in fingerprints, and goes back to Sean's house to look more closely. She finds a raised fingerprint on an index card, shoved in a book, which leads the CSIs to Matthew Babjide.

## Quotes

**Brass:** You'd rather deliver notification to next of kin [...]? That doesn't sound like the down and dirty Sara I used to know.
**Sara:** I like to see where haters come from.
