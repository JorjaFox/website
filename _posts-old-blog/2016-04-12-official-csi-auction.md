Not mine. I'll be doing it (I hope...) end of this month or early next month (the tl;dr is that I spent MarchÂ _very_ sick, but I seem to be doing better now).

However starting Friday, CBS is auctioning off a whole bunch of CSI memorabilia. And yes, there's a whole <a href="http://auction.screenbid.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/52/?page=1&amp;key=Sara&amp;cat=&amp;xclosed=yes">Sara Section</a> you can pic through. I won't be bidding but a lot of Sara's necklaces are there so those of you who have always asked about them, jump in!
