We'll start with the interview, from TV Guide Magazine:
<blockquote>While executive producer Anthony Zuiker was mum and [Jorja] Fox was cagey on some high-tech opening sequence that she’d only say “will knock your socks off,” Helgenberger showed a little leg, or tried to. “It starts with this technique, it’s this lack of better way of describing it – these specialty cameras, almost this freeze-action kind of thing – but it’s really impressive. I haven’t seen the opening yet, but it was very arduous shooting it. Everyone seems really impressed with how it’s turned out.” Said Fox: “When I read it, I was like, ‘Really, we’re going to do that? Really? You’re kidding.’ It’s pretty cool. We shot it in July, they’ll be working on it until about 48 hours before it goes on.”
</blockquote>

Which leads us nicely into the video, that displays that technique!

And let's round it out with a reminder that the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20090912-csilv/">CSI: Experience opening at the MGM Grand Gallery</a> is jam packed with yummy photos!

Updated to add that CBS decided 'Oh shoot! YouTube!' and put up a higher quality (US only) version of the video.

And yes, around 34 second mark, it sure looks like Sara's sporting a ring.
