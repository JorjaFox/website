It's a Strip-to-strip week for "C.S.I."

The new prime-time crime drama about Las Vegas forensic investigators, which debuted last Friday on CBS, visits its small-screen hometown for three days starting Thursday.

And the whole "C.S.I" starring crew will be along for the ride - one of them literally.

Series star William L. Petersen, who plays Criminalistics Bureau chief Gil Grissom, will brave the Manhattan Express roller coaster atop New York-New York for one scene. (If the grisly crime scenes he investigates don't make him sick, he should be able to endure the coaster's trademark heartline loop without losing his lunch.)

Joining Petersen on the road trip will be "C.S.I." regulars Marg Helgenberger (who plays Catherine Willows), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) and Paul Guilfoyle (Capt. Jim Brass).

Other locations on the show's Vegas schedule range from casino interiors to residential exteriors, along with stops at the Jockey Club parking lot and the Spearmint Rhino strip club.

And what would a made-in-Vegas TV show be without a chase along the Strip?

Most of the scenes will figure in the show's sixth episode, "Who Are You," which is keyed to the lyrics of the Who's rock song of the same name.
