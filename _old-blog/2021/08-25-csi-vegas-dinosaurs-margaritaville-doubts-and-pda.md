To hit on what Im sure you're also wondering...

<h4>Why did Jorja come back?</h4>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">I was also hesitant—I felt like the story left Sara and Grissom in paradise together—but getting to work with William Petersen again? They had me at hello!<cite>TV Insider</cite></blockquote>

<h4>What's the deal with GSR?</h4>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">**Fox:** First of all, I love Sara and Grissom. I always will. Not to talk about the olden days too much, but even though we were together, we weren’t together. We were [secretly] married, we were divorced. Embarking on this phase, we’re going to meet them not only as a couple that’s together, but a couple that’s been living on and off a boat together for several years.**Petersen:** We’re working on saving and studying fish, protecting sharks, down in South America somewhere.**Fox:** We kind of pulled a Jimmy Buffet.**Petersen:** We’re in Margaritaville.</blockquote>

<h4>Will there be actual PDA this time?</h4>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">**Petersen:** Our attraction to each other was always based on the work. We were always in some kind of mind meld when we were working. There was nobody he would rather be in the lab with or on a crime scene with than Sara. She got it. She got him, and he eventually got her.**Fox:** [Grinning] The show is going to air at 10pm, so we can be a little edgier than we were last time.</blockquote>

So... what are you excited about?
