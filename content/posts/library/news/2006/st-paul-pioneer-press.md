Don't worry, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" fans. CBS will not be changing the name of its hit drama to "When Sara Met Grissom." But the network will continue to explore the love of these two forensic nerds.

Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the Top 10-rated series, says she's excited about the possibilities. Fox says she's excited that Sara and Gil are finally acting on the sexual tension in the series' seventh season.

The May-December romance (actor William Petersen is 53, so presumably his character is, too) also brings Fox a little job security. Two years ago, CBS fired and then rehired Fox after she initially refused to sign a return-to-work agreement.

Here's what the 38-year-old New York native had to say:

On Sara and Gil hooking up: "Sara was originally a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom. So being that it was on there (the original script), I was very intrigued and sort of thought it might happen. I think one of the coolest things about it, and the way that the story ended up being delivered at the end of season six, is to suddenly find these characters together, and we know how long it's been going on. I think it's brilliant."

On "CSI's" creative process: "You know, you just get this little description, and you take the journey. And the writers and producers are really kind. If there's someplace we don't really want to go or we really don't feel safe, we can go to them, and generally they'll change the course or direction for us."
