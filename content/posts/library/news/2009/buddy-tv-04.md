Admit it, that question is very much a natural, not after that long string of events stretching way back to the seventh season of "CSI"-Sara and Grissom finally address their relationship, the Miniature Killer gets in the way, she leaves to address her past, he leaves to move on (to her, natch)...

But yes, just in case you still can't believe what you've read elsewhere, Jorja Fox is returning to the tenth season of "CSI". Reps from CBS confirmed that she will be returning in the tenth season premiere, which airs on September 24, as well as in additional episodes yet to be disclosed.

"We're thrilled for Jorja's return," executive producer Carol Mendelsohn said. Well, of course. The important bit here is the reason why Sara is returning: viewers will, she promised, "discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the "CSI" team in Las Vegas."

Fox left "CSI" in the middle of the eighth season, but returning for several episodes in the ninth, notably the season premiere marking Warrick's death, and that episode when Grissom finally left the team to be with her. And their first kiss, yes. Her only other appearance will be on the Lifetime comedy "Drop Dead Diva", where she'll take a guest role in an episode airing next month.

Network reps won't comment, however, whether Petersen will be returning to the show on an on-screen capacity. (Remember, he's producing "CSI", too.) I understand they're being tight-lipped-besides, it would just ruin the suspense when we discover that Sara Sidle is, in fact, Sara Grissom... okay, that's just me.
