The schedule for Wednesday is as follows:

**WEDNESDAY**
8:00-9:00 PM _SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC_
9:00-10:00 PM _CRIMINAL MINDS_
10:00-11:00 PM _CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION_

I can't really say I'm totally shocked at this turn of events.  _CSI_ has been malingering on Thursday

, and personally, I'm glad it's not on Friday!  It does mean I have to re-think same day screencaps, assuming Jorja comes back (which we still don't know, and won't probably until next month).  For now, I'll try to do it same day, but since that may keep me up till midnight, and I leave the house at 6am on Thursdays, it may just not happen.

What does this mean for the longevity of the crime solving show?  I would think this is the last chance for _CSI_ to prove itself.  If it doesn't get decent ratings, and there's anything to replace it, CBS will get rid of the show that catapulted them into dominance a decade ago.  This may also be the start of a serious shake-up for the cast, but we won't know that for a while yet.  Everyone's still in negotiations.

What do you think about _CSI_ jumping to Wednesday?  Good move?  Bad call?  The end of it all?  Speak up in the comments!
