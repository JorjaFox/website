Where in the world are Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom when Season 2 of _CSI: Vegas_ opens up? TVLine’s exclusive sneak peek at the new season has the answer to that question.

Though both Jorja Fox and William Petersen reprised their original _CSI_ roles in Season 1, the latter had only signed on for that initial 10-episode run (but stayed on as an executive producer). Fox subsequently announced that she would not continue on either, explaining, “I personally just can’t split Sara and Grissom up again…. Wherever they go, they belong together.”

In the sneak peek above, CSI Chris Park (promoted series regular Jay Lee) is marveling over the fact that Catherine Willows (again played by _CSI_ vet Marg Helgenberger) has come out of retirement to help out Maxine Roby’s (Paula Newsome) Las Vegas CSI team.

When Park wonders aloud if Willows reached out to Sara and Gil for the hot goss on Roby’s team, fellow CSI Joshua Folsom (Matt Lauria) reveals just how _in communicado_ Sara and Gil now are. [...]
