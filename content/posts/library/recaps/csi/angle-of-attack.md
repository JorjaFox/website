## Synopsis

A 'hit and run' is found on the streets of Vegas, but curiously matches none of the markers one would expect. The case only gets odder when they determine the man fell from a building blocks away, being thrown through glass thick enough to take a bullet. At first the lab suspects a missile, but they determine it's a Squirrel Suit and manage to ID the deceased: Captain Robert Holland, Air Force.

Capt. Holland had taken an experimental suit without full permission from the R&D lab: TRD. Unbeknownst to him the suit had been tampered with so the emergency parachute would never fire. One of the TRD workers, another pilot, dies in the middle of an interrogation of a cerebral edemas.

Holland was having an affair with his CO, who killed him to cover up their homosexual relationship. He killed the other pilot because he thought Holland told him.
