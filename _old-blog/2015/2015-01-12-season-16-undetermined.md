By now you've all heard about how Ted Danson is going to be on _Fargo_ next season. It's a 10-episode short season (practically a miniseries). Many people have speculated this means _CSI_ is done and this is the last season. Even <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fargo-fills-season-2-cast-761975">Hollywood Reporter</a> is unsure:

<blockquote>For _CSI_ leading man Danson, Fargo will be filmed during his hiatus from the CBS procedural. The long-running drama has seen its ratings slide this season — and episode count reduced — and it's unclear if the network will renew the series for an additional season. </blockquote>

This week has been the Television Critics Association up-fronts, where stations talk about what's coming next. CBS has already renewed a few shows, which brings up, of course, the question of _CSI_:

I personally don't think we'll know until we see how well _CSI: Cyber_ does this spring. And even then, CBS gave a send-off to _The Mentalist_ with a special final season. Given that _CSI_ was part of CBS' resurgence fifteen (wow) years ago, I would expect at least a short miniseries type closure.

I leave you with Nina's quote:

<blockquote>We haven’t determined yet what’s going to happen with _CSI_. The show continues to be a strong performer and does very well in its time period. You look at the journey that the show has gone on [with assorted cast changes over the years]... We’re just incredibly proud.</blockquote>
