I must love you guys. Transcribing 18 minutes and change is not simple, fast, or easy. In fact, it's only _slightly_ less annoying than it was in 2000. It's 2013! Where's my flying car and auto-transcription service!?

So here's the audio:

And of course I have for you a transcription: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/CableTV.com_(24_September_2013)">CableTV Interview</a>

Cute things to note!
<ul>
	<li>This is Jorja's 18th consecutive year in prime time</li>
	<li>Jorja calls the flashbacks in ep 300 'fauxbacks'</li>
	<li>Jorja wore a wig for the fauxbacks</li>
	<li>Jorja totally would have come back after all the love was shown her by the fans in 2007, had she not been so tired</li>
</ul>
Read the transcript to glean more adorable moments. That last one melted my heart.
