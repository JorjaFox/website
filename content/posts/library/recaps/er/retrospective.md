## Quotes

_On watching the show:_

**Jorja:** When you watched the show, you felt smarter.

_On filming the show:_

**Jorja:** It was absolutely terrifying for me.

_What it felt like:_

**Jorja:** I just remember just Fridays. Fridays were insane. The show would air Thursday night, across America, and people who were going to work on Fridays or getting to work on Friday, would spend a good part of their morning talking about 'ER' and what had happened the night before.

_On the cast and friends:_

**Jorja:** This is a collection of people with an amazing sense of humor. George Clooney is legendary for it, legendary.
