**Player: Jorja Fox**

**Previously On:** 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'

**New Project:** Um ... 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'

**You Can Go Home Again:** "We're thrilled for Jorja's return to 'CSI,'" said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. "The viewers and longtime 'CSI' fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the 'CSI' team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode."

**Follow the (Ratings) Evidence:** Looks like the addition of Laurence Fishburne hasn't satisfied viewers as much as producers had hoped, who acknowledge the drop in ratings and claim to be 'listening' to fans who haven't gotten over last year's departure of three original cast members.

**Premiere Date:** Thursday, Sept. 24 at 9 p.m. on CBS
