As usual, Jorja's interview was at the very end, and rushed because they were running out of time.

Really quickly we got that there's only one way to train an elephant, and even zoos use this.  You beat the elephant.  Train by pain.  This is not humane in any way at all.  Go to animal sanctuaries, not zoos, not circuses.

There should be a transcript up tomorrow or Sunday, as CNN is really good about that.  They're also really picky about posting video, which when you combine it with that they ran over (and my video was cut off) you will have to make do with screenshots.
