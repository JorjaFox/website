The February 3rd episode of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" will have a pair of Grissoms facing off, but unfortunately, neither of them will be Gil Grissom, the role vacated a couple of years ago by William Petersen. Rather, it will be Grissom's wife Sara (Jorja Fox) and his mother, who isn't Fox had left the hit crime series the year before Petersen, but she returned for his final scene on the show, the couple closing things out with a big kiss. Last season, Fox returned to the show for a handful of appearances. Her character sported a wedding ring and was occasionally referred to by her married name of Grissom.

In the current season, the CBS show hasn't made many Grissom references even though Fox has returned as a regular, appearing in a majority, but not all, of the episodes. That's why this news is rather exciting.

Playing the role of Gil's mom is Phyllis Frelich, the deaf actress who achieved acclaim with her performance in Children of a Lesser God on Broadway. The role was taken over by Marlee Matlin when made into a film. Interestingly, Matlin is also going to appear in this TV episode as Mrs. Grissom's preferred daughter-in-law.

There is a murder to be solved so it won't be all soap opera, and who knows, maybe Petersen can be talked into a brief cameo. Viewers can always dream.
