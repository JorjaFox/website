## Synopsis

Eleven girls have had their hair mysteriously cut by an unknown assailiant, dubbed the Shear Stalker, in public places. But hair cutting turns to murder when a previous victim is found dead in her home, with her eyes cut out. She was killed by an overdose of morphine, and then bleached her hair and styled her in retro clothes, shoving a small braid of hair down her throat. A second woman is killed _after_ her makeup is applied, and instead of her eyes being gouged out, she's been blinded.

Their clothes are vintage '70s, not remakes, and show signs as having been in storage. When combined with some hair found on the scene, the CSIs find Mrs. Kemp, who appears to be the inspiration for the killer. She had lost her hair to chemo, however her wig was made of her own hair, made by a wigmaker who took some of her dresses as ... inspiration.

Jeffery Fitzgerald is brought in, his studio searched, and evidence is found: hair samples, wigs and morphine. Before they can find enough for a conviction, a third woman is killed, this one managing to contact D.B. before being killed. Since Jeffery is in custody at the time, and the hairs at the studio don't match the women, he's let go.

Hairs at the scene and a photo of a young Mrs. Kemp lead the CSIs to look at her son, Adam, however it's Lucinda Kemp's doctor, whose mother looked much like Mrs. Kemp, who was the killer. His mother also had cancer.

## Review

Sara works the case with D.B., cracking morbid jokes with Morgan while processing the apartment of the dead girl. She is also friendly with Hodges, ribbing him in the lab. Working closely with D.B., she hypothesizes on what the killer's motives may be. Sara also convinces a doctor to break doctor/patient confidentiality and get the CSI's information on the killer's 'inspiration.'

When arrested, Jeffery stares at Sara's hair, creeping her out. She gets too latched on to the idea of Jeffery being the killer and appologizes to D.B. for chasing the wrong rabbits.

## Notes

* Sara likes Daniel Craig.
* When faced with a psycho attacking women, Sara leans towards her 'Ted Bundy' place.
