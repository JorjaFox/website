Without a whole lot of notice (thanks guys) the event date has changed to 9/16.

That's _WEDNESDAY the 16th_

Don't bother asking me about the details, I know nothing more than I've posted here. So while the Tweets and DMs and emails are always polite, you're going to get a lot of "I don't know." because I don't have any additional information.

To recap:

* The Q&A will be live streamed on Yahoo (probably at https://screen.yahoo.com/paley/)
* I plan to attend (though if it's moved to the 15th I won't be able to go)
* Jorja is still on the list of attendees
* Wally said he's planning to go
* <del datetime="2015-08-11T21:02:21+00:00">I don't know if there will be a meet & greet</del> There are no meet & greets at these events (thanks, Shane!)
* I don't know if they're really going to show the whole finale (stranger things have happened)
* I don't know if the video will be Closed Captioned
* I don't know if the video will be archived

Good luck folks. I'm sure I'll see some of you there!
