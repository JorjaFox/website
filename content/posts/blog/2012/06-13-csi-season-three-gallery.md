Even more old CSI photos. Some of these are brand new to JFO, some are better quality.

There were so many, I decided just to leave it like this. Nice times, remembering Hank, eh?

There have been a few more gallery tweaks. If you have javascript, and thus can use the nifty color box, all the images for a gallery will load on a page, so you can see all of them without having to paginate (which was annoying). Otherwise it's the old way.

How's it working out for everyone?
