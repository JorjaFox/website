JORJA FOX (CSI, Five, 9pm)

**Age:** 37.

**Style:** Fox by name ...

**Significant others:** Just her two cats and a dog.

**Finest hour:** Landing the role of *CSI*'s Sara Sidle, straight after making the hit movie *Memento*.

**Don't mention:** Pay rises. In 2004, Jorja and one of her *CSI* co-stars, George Eads, were fired from the show. Both denied they were holding out for more monet, and claimed their sackings were down to several misunderstandings.

**She says:** 'There's no such thing as a bad day when you're going in to work with those guys' - on her attractive co-stars George Clooney (*ER*), Rob Lowe (*The West Wing*) and Gary Dourdan (*CSI*).
