This past week at Austin City Hall, councilor Lee Leffingwell met with CSI actress Jorja Fox at a press conference held by Animal Defenders International (ADI) and confirmed he would certainly look in to the issue of circus animal cruelty in Austin.

Leffingwell accepted a letter, report and DVD from Fox, on behalf of the campaigning group, which asks for the city council to consider a ban on animal circuses in light of the evidence presented by ADI's report and undercover footage.

After receiving the scientific report and undercover footage, which Animal Defenders International claims shows animals suffering and abused at the hands of circus trainers, Leffingwell confirmed that every year the Austin City Council receives numerous comments from the public concerned about the treatment of animals in circuses.

Footage on this particular tape allegedly includes an elephant being beaten and brought to her knees by a circus handler wielding a golf club.

Councilor Leffingwell stated, "I think just about every year when the circus comes to town we get a lot of emails and comments about the treatment of animals, specifically elephants."

"I know it's a matter of concern to people in the community," Leffingwell added. "I think it is something, certainly, we will take a look at."

Jorja Fox was thrilled to have been able to meet the councilor and hand over the letter and has been supporting ADI's campaign in to move for a ban on animal circuses in America

Jan Creamer, ADI USA President said, "We are heartened that the people of Austin have already demonstrated their compassion for these animals, that the council is responding, and we look forward to the city joining the many others around the world that have said no to this cruelty."

Some of the worst abuse revealed featured a trainer from Cut and Shoot north of Houston who was allegedly filmed by ADI viciously beating an elephant and even dragging the animal to its knees and kicking it in the face.

"We believe Texans will be horrified that such cruelty could be taking place on their doorstep," Creamer said in closing.
