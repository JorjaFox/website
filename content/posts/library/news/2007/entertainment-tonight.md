"The actress will hang up her badge in November."

ET confirms that **JORJA FOX** will be leaving "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." She will exit the long-running drama sometime in November.

In last season's cliffhanger, it was unclear whether Fox's character, investigator Sara Sidle, would be returning to the show, as her life hung in the balance after she was attacked by the "Miniature Killer."

Fox, who has also starred on "The West Wing" and "ER," has been on "CSI" since its beginning in 2000.
