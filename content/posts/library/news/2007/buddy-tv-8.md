The noise surrounding Jorja Fox's reported departure on "CSI" has fueled fans to exert great efforts to keep her character, Sara Sidle, on the CBS show. Although the 39-year-old actress has neither confirmed nor denied the controversy, supporters have quickly found ways to demonstrate their support by putting up websites such as The Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign and Dollars for Sense.

So far, fans' efforts include sending letters and flyers to the CBS studios and signing online petitions. Flyers have already been sent from 39 countries, while an online petition called "Keep Jorja Fox on "CSI"," has already obtained more than 2,100 signatures. Fans are also trying to raise money through the "Keep Jorja Fox on CSI" campaign which has already sent 100 balloons to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn at the "CSI" offices along with cards that said, "Don't Burst Our Bubble! Keep Jorja Fox on "CSI"." Moreover, there's even a plane that does a flyover while trailing a "Keep Jorja Fox on CBS" banner.

In response to her supporters, Fox herself has responded to the fan support by sending a letter to The Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign which clearly conveys her gratitude and appreciation for all their efforts.

"And everyday this week as I arrive somebody knocks on my trailer door and delivers flowers. Beautiful flowers," she wrote. "Thank you all so much. I have the coolest, most wonderful fans ever, seriously, hands down. I'm blown away. And honestly, the pleasure and the privilege is all mine."

Fox joined "CSI" in 2000 as a material and element analyst of the Las Vegas forensic team. The news about her departure came after her reportedly rocky contract negotiations with the show's producers. According to many sources, it was the inability of the actress and the producers to come to terms on a salary boost, which they had been negotiating since January, that finally decided her fate on the CBS series.
