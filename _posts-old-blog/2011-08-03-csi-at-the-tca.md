What's a TCA?  <a href="http://tvcritics.org/">Television Critics Association</a>.  Basically they all get a happy 'This is what's going to happen on _this_ TV show!' panel.  Attending the _CSI_ panel were Ted Danson, Marg Helgenberger, George Eads, Carol Mendelsohn, and Don McGill.  Alas, no Jorja.

Important takeaways!
<ul>
	<li>Carol Mendelsohn says the show will have a lighter tone (think season 1-4).</li>
	<li>Ted Danson's character is named DB Russell and has four kids.</li>
	<li>Family is a theme for the season.</li>
	<li>There will be fallout from Langston's departure (including moving Catherine and Nick's fetal pig).</li>
	<li>Marg on her departure: "I was planning to leave _CSI_ but had a hard time letting go and leaving the cast - that's why I'm still here."  However she intends for this to be her last season.</li>
	<li>Specifically, they wanted DB Russell to be less of a nerd. Says Mendelsohn "We wanted a scientist; we wanted a Sherlock Holmes; we did not want a science nerd."</li>
</ul>
There was a clip shown of Danson's first episode which you can see over at EW: <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/03/ted-danson-csi-video/">http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/03/ted-danson-csi-video/</a> and CSI Files ran a <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2011/08/report-csi-takes-the-stage-at-cbs-tca/">Live Blog</a> of it.
