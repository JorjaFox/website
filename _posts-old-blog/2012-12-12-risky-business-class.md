– **“CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,”** 10 p.m., CBS. A plane crashes near the Las Vegas strip, killing five people. Sara (Jorja Fox), already feeling the strain of her long-distance relationship with Grissom, is soon working with her former lover (Josh Randall of “Ed” and “Courting Alex”).

Extra tidbits? According to Shane (who was on set for some of the shooting), Jorja had to stand on a box in some scenes.
