Alas, Jorja's still smoking.

<blockquote>[Nelly], who performed until nearly 2 a.m., drew a few notable celebrities, including Charlize Theron and a bleached-blond Cyndi Lauper, both of whom jived upstairs in the VIP balcony and CSIâ€™s Jorja Fox, who looked skinnier than a straw and was smoking up a storm on the well-populated back patio.</blockquote>
