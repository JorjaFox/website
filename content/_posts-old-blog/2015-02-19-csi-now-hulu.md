This has been in the works a while, but it's great to see:

<blockquote>Hulu has acquired the exclusive subscription video on demand (SVOD) rights to all previous seasons of CBSâ€™s award-winning, critically acclaimed crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, it was announced today by Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins, and Scott Koondel, Chief Corporate Content Licensing Officer for CBS Corporation. All episodes will be available for streaming on Hulu with a Plus subscription beginning early April.</blockquote>
