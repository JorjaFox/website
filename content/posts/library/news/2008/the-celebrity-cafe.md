SPOILER ALERT

Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on the original "CSI", will return for at least the show's ninth season premiere next fall, according to the show's boss, Carol Mendelsohn.

The news comes via "TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, who says that Fox's character won't be in a flashback, but the most likely scenario would be Sara returning to Vegas to mourn the death of ex-colleague Warrick. Who, of course, was shot and (presumably) killed in last week's season finale.

The reason for the "presumably" is because Warrick, played by Gary Dourdan, will also be back in the show's ninth season, and also not in just flashbacks. According to Ausiello, Warrick will most likely be involved in what he calls a "gut-wrenching death scene."

The reasons for Fox and Dourdan's departures were very different. On one hand, Fox left because of burnout and the desire to try something new. Dourdan, as TheCelebrityCafe.com has reported, was recently arrested for possessing heroin, and other drugs.
