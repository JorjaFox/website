As you regular JFOers know, Animal Acres is one of Jorja's favorite charities.  If you happen to be short on cash, but willing to donate some spare items, please consider emailing info@animalacres.com and asking if they have need for your old TV or DVD player, for their rescue and education programs.

On the wishlist are TVs (HD or otherwise), DVD players, blankets, quilts, office supplies, folding chairs and tables, plastic tarps, and microwaves.
