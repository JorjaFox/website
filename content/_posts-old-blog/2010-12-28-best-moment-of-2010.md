Okay, you know this HAD to be getting invited to meet Jorja.  The rest of my year has been pretty up-and-down, but I look back at February and just get a dumb smile on my face.  Meeting Joe Fab was the icing on a pretty awesome cake, and William Petersen was just chocolate sprinkles.  I may have worked my metaphor too far there.

Best 2010 moment was seeing Jorja's name back in the opening credits of CSI!!!

Definitely the news about The Two Mrs. Grissom's. That made my life.

It will be her wonderful acting performance in House Of Hoaders! Especially the moment she talks about her mum killing her father!

Her performance this whole season! She’s been so amazing! In house of Hoarders, bump and grind and every other episode she’s been on.

Hearing that she’ll be in more than 11 episodes was a good moment for me :)
