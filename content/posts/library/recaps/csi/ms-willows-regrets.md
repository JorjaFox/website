## Synopsis

Lawyer Malcom Turner and his staff are all murdered by people armed with FN-P90.  Their deaths were a professional hit, arranged by Mark Gabriel, looking to prevent his wife Laura (who is Catherine's childhood friend) from spilling his secrets. The lawyer was one Catherine sent Laura too, and after following the trail left by Laura, they find her hiding in the crawlspace of a house. The FBI take Laura into protective custody, as it seems Mark is conducting terrorist affairs on US soil. One of the hitmen sneaks into the FBI detail and kill Laura. Catherine is sent home, only to email her resignation to CSI and be attacked and have her house shot up.

She's rescued by D.B., who shows up just in time to drive her away, however Catherine has been shot. Her fate is left unknown until the next episode, "Willows In The Wind".

## Review

Sara and Morgan investigate the lawyers offices, where the victims were killed, but initially find no evidence. In fact the place is too clean, prompting Sara to mention Natalie Davis: the janitor who was a killer. It's also Sara who takes apart a birthday card sent to Catherine's mother, but labeled for Catherine. The card is signed by Laura's father (who's been dead 20 years) and only handled by Laura. When Sara takes it apart, she finds a hidden memory chip with photos.

## Notes

* Sara is able to talk about Natalie now.

## Quotes

**Sara:** You know, the only janitor I knew who cleaned this throughly turned out to be a serial killer.
