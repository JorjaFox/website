Happy Birthday, Jorja Fox, and many happy returns!

Your fans have organized a scrapbook and raised a few thousand dollars for charity, and many have become more ecologically conscious and even turned to vegetarianism, all because of your influence.  When you look back on the last 40 years of your life, remember that you did indeed change the world in your own way.

Best wishes from the staff of JFO.  We can't wait to see what comes next.
