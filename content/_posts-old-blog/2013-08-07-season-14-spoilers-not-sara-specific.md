So while we're waiting on substantial spoilers for Sara, how about some general ones for the season? This post was tagged for spoilers, so while they're pretty benign in so far as they go, they are giving things away.

Let's start with Teal Redman (Ellie Brass) coming back!
<blockquote>The daughter is back. CSI Files has learned exclusively that **Teal Redmann** will be returning to <em>CSI: Crime Scene</em> Investigation as Brass’ (**Paul Guilfoyle**) daughter Ellie.

Though credited for appearances in last season’s “Strip Maul” and “Skin in the Game,” Redmann’s last appearance was in Season Six’s “Way to Go.” Due to scheduling and the small nature of involvement in those two installments, Redmann did not physically appear and a body double was used instead. After last season’s finale, which saw Ellie and Morgan Brody (**Elisabeth Harnois**) kidnapped by the Dante’s Inferno killer, Redmann will reprise her role in the premiere with a much larger presence.</blockquote>

And now... well, look, we all knew Morgan was going to live, right?
<blockquote>**I'd love some spoilers for the <em>CSI </em>premiere. — <em>Shawn</em>
ADAM:** You might want to grab some hankies. Although this year's first episode once again deals with the team searching for a kidnapped loved one, executive producer Don McGill warns fans to prepare for a less rosy outcome than a year ago. "A person close to the CSI family will die," he reports. "The first image of the premiere is a memorial service. If fans look closely, they will notice some faces missing. So the question is: Who's in the casket?" Although McGill says that everyone on the team is touched by the loss, look for D.B. Russell to take it particularly hard. "He's in crisis by the end; he feels responsible," McGill says. "The decisions he made, he really will have to pay for. We'll see as the season progresses that there may be some questioning of his purpose."</blockquote>

"A person <em>close</em> to the CSI family..." (emphasis mine) implies it's not Morgan. But at the same time, I don't think it's Ellie. We know it's not Sara, Nick, or Greg, by the way. I'm hoping for someone out of left field. Who do you want to die?

Let's end with a public non-spoiler
