These times are tough for *CSI*. Yeah, the show still does well in the ratings, but the series has lost its mojo since William Petersen's Gil Grissom left two years ago. [...]

The return of Jorja for as Sara Sidle hasn't really upped the energy level. (If anything, the shoe has suffered a bit by loosing another woman - Liz Vassey as the sparky "lab rat" Wendy Simms.)

Now in its 11th season, *CSI* still airs good hours, and coexecutive producers Treena Hancock and Melissa R. Byer are talented writers who authored two of this season's better episodes, November's "Wild Life" and Feb. 3's "The Two Mrs. Grissoms," which treated us to a fleeting glimpse of Gil Grissom via a video-chat conversation with Sara. Even tucked away on a screen-within-a-screen, Petersen exuded the kind of energy and bristling curiosity that *CSI* too frequently lacks these days.
