On Saturday the 11th, there will be activists in cities around the world to take part in the "International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos".  There will be events and demonstrations to send the message that these beautiful animals should be free.

Oh and Jorja's endorsing the International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos:
<blockquote>“Jorja Fox here, asking you to please support this year’s International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos! We need to put the focus where it belongs – on protecting elephants in their natural habitats – and stop wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on artificial zoo displays that will never meet their needs. Instead of cruel confinement and domination, let’s offer sanctuary, peace, compassion and hope. It’s up to each and every one of us to take a stand for the elephants now in order to ensure their welfare in captivity and their continued existence on this planet.”</blockquote>
