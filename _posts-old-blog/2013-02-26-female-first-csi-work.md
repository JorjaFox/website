<blockquote>**<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/url.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6663" alt="Guitar" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/url-300x243.jpeg" width="300" height="242" /></a>Is it true that you have a rather special guitar?**

Oh, I do, I wish I could play it the way I feel like it should! I like to actually loan it to people to play because it’s just an amazing guitar and I never really do it any justice. I have this blonde 1965 hollow body Rickenbacher and they didn’t make many of them and it’s really just like listening to angels.

**Is music something you’d like to explore more then?**

I don’t have the time yet. Oddly enough when I was younger my number one dream was to be the lead singer in a rock and roll band. Acting ended up being the place where I was able to carve out a living for myself, so there was a point where I let go of music professionally.

It was hard for a minute, letting go of any dream is going to be like that, but it’s something that I do now just for the fun of it. I love the fact that it’s not professional, that it’s just me and some friends who get together and play. It’s nice to have something that’s not about making a living or trying to impress anyone else.</blockquote>
Of course there's some CSI stuff in there too, but this was the most resonant part to me. Oh and I don't know if that's 'the' guitar, but it's certainly a blond Rickenbacker.
