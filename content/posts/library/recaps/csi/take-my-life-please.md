## Synopsis

Knuckles, a legendary comic from the good old days of Las Vegas is set to reunite with his partner, Bernie Nash, on stage for one night only, until one half of the famous duo is found dead. Nash is dead in his dressing room on opening night with alcohol and oxycodine in his system, and evidence of sexual activity scratched into his back. Nash's death looks to be natural (an accidental overdose) until Doc Robbins determines he drowned in his own dressing room, 12 feet from a toilet.

Fingernail polish matching that of Knuckles' wife, Terpsie Pratt, is found in Nash's back. She claims to never have slept with him, even though Nash has been hitting on her for years, until he caught her fooling around with a stage manager. Terpsie gave Nash the old college try, but he couldn't keep it up, and was alive when she left. Bingo, as it happens, has a prescription for oxy.

The CSIs trace the water in Nash's lungs to the ice machine, and the red hair to Knuckles' toupee. Knuckles admits to killing Nash, because he could no longer keep at the routine. He was no longer funny.

Kurtis Torse's body with over a hundred bullet holes in his body is found, with head, feet and hands severed (and missing) from the bullets, dumped in an alley, with a gun, and a fingertip shoved into his body. Torse happens to be on the FBI top ten most wanted list, after blowing up an abortion clinic in Seattle, and has been on the run for years, leaving behind a wife and two children. The bullets in his body are traced back to an indoor firing range that only permits the bullets to be used on-site, but there's no evidence in the range of blood.

Trace points the body to a magnasite river wash in Koral, Nevada, downstream from the biggest magnasite mine in the US. The CSIs arrive to find an immense open air shootout, complete with the same bullets found in Torse's body. After an all night search of the property, they finally find body parts, leading them back to the fence behind a van that the shootout participants used for target practice. An accidental murder.

## Review

Sara works with Catherine and Ray on the body found in the alley. She finds the fingertip that IDs Torse and goes with Ray to the firing range. Later, at the shootout site, Sara finds Torse's foot and finger.

## Notes

* Sara had no idea there was a huge indoor firing range phenomenon in Las Vegas.
* Sara only goes to PD firing ranges.
