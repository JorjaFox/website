 A tireless advocate for the rights and welfare of animals, people and the environment alike, Jorja Fox is a brilliant fit as the Spring '09 "face" of Green with Glamour.

A vegetarian for over 20 years, Jorja has thoughfully utilized her celebrity for positive purposes since her breakout role as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER. After 3 seasons on NBC's long-running hospital hit, Jorja continued to make her mark with strong & sexy parts on The West Wing and more recently as a major player on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as forensic scientist, Sara Sidle... all the while raising awareness for notable organizations including ADI (Animal Defenders International, dedicated to ending the abominable treatment of circus animals), CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates, aiding foster children), PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), and the Human Rights Campaign.

We were quickly drawn in by Jorja's strength, compassion, sultry good looks (which never hurts!) and unwaivering dedication to fair treatment and equal rights for all creatures - and we are honored to have her as such a prominent part of Green with Glamour!
