Some of you have seen the latest article in TV Guide (if not, read<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/TV_Guide_Magazine_(September_22-28_2014)"> TV Guide Magazine: Returning Favorites - CSI</a>). But here's the big thing from Don McGill, exec producer:
<blockquote>Naturally, there's more mayhem, but also a possible romance: A shooter will open fire at a CSI convention, endangering the women of the lab, while Nick (George Eads) uncovers suggestions of the supernatural when he investigates the death of a high school chemistry teacher. "Sara [Jorja Fox] and Greg [Eric Szmanda] will face down death, very literally, when a plague scare hits Vegas," says McGill. "The event will draw them together, suggesting a closeness we may not have seen before."</blockquote>
So. First off, the CSI convention is "Girls Gone Wilder" (ep 5) and the 'death scare' would be "Bad Blood" (ep 3) and ... okay, yes, the closeness is something we haven't seen before. Is it _romance_? That will all depend on how the actors play out the scenes.

What do you think about a Sara/Greg romance? How would you even portmanteau that one... Sidle + Sanders ... Sinders? Burns with a flame! I'm still up for Hodle personally (Sidle + Hodges).
