CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION stars MARG HELGENBERGER and JORJA FOX will be showing off their singing skills as a duo at an upcoming charity concert. The actresses are reportedly working on a rendition of BEN E KING's STAND BY ME for the fourth annual What A Pair benefit, which raises cash for breast cancer charities. Helgenberger, whose mother is a breast cancer survivor, is a longtime supporter of the event which, this year, will also feature the vocal talents of actresses JESSICA BIEL, LEA THOMPSON and JOELY FISHER. The event will take place at Los Angeles' Wiltern Theater on 11 June (06).
