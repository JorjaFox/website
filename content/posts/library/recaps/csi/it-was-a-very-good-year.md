## Synopsis

Someone Greg knows is found cut to ribbons in a piano in the middle of the desert. Alison Bailey helped Greg with his Vegas book, and they quasi-dated for a week. It appears Alison was killed due to her research into the Vegas good-old-boy crime network, concerning the death of Ledo Wright, a pianist. Matters become more convoluted when the piano containing her body was that of Ledo's.

Back in the sixties, a man named Tommy Grazetti killed Ledo Wright to get in with Sinatra and his Rat Pack. Only the truth is that Ledo assumed Tommy's identity. While everyone assumes he killed Tommy, it wasn't true. Tommy died, choking on his food, and Ledo assumed his identity so as not to go to war in Vietnam.

Vinyl tracings found on Alison's body are traced back to a rare Sinatra record, which was purchased by a Sinatra impersonator at Tommy/Ledo's Rat Pack club. Alison had bought the record for Greg. The Frank Sinatra impersonator, a little off his rocker, killed her over it and dumped her in the piano, which was picked up for it's scheduled maintenance, and then dumped in the desert by the terrified driver.
