I'll update the post Saturday night, once I have screencaps etc.  Yeah, **Saturday** night. I won't be home until then!  If someone else wants to write up a recap, post it in the comments here or email it to webmaster@jorjafox.net and great thanks will be yours! Until then, don't blow things up.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
Langston fights for his life after being stabbed by psychopath Nate Haskell, while the other CSIs attend a funeral that turns deadly.

<h2>Recap</h2>
<del>_Coming Soon!_</del>

Three stars.  Not a bad ep, but a very standard CSI episode, as opposed to a great season premiere.  And yes, Jorja was in the opening credits.  I found out shortly after I was out of the house and without a way to share!  But I did like that the episode ended with a 'This isn't over....' ending.
