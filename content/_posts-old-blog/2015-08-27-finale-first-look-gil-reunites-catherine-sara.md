Entertainment Weekly is trying to make up for Entertainment Tonight's suckage!

<blockquote>Is your hankie handy, CSI fans?

Production has wrapped on the goodbye movie planned for Sept. 27 on CBS. In an exclusive first look obtained by EW, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) and Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) look for clues one last time on the long-running procedural drama. 

“I’m so glad we were able to do this, to go and be with the crew and the cast again, to be able to say goodbye,” Petersen tells EW. “It was really a big to-do for us.”

Most of the original ensemble will reunite for the two-hour flick. Besides Petersen and Helgenberger, Paul Guilfoyle returned to the set to reprise his role as Jim Brass. The rest of the cast includes Ted Danson (D.B. Russell), Jon Wellner (Henry Andrews), David Berman (David Phillips), Wallace Langham (David Hodges), Elisabeth Harnois (Morgan Brody), Robert David Hall (Dr. Al Robbins), Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders), and Melinda Clarke as Lady Heather. There will be two notable absences: Elisabeth Shue, who played Julie Finlay, and George Eads, aka Nick Stokes.

The show’s creator, Anthony Zuiker, penned the script. </blockquote>

You'll have to read the article in the print magazine to get the rest. Awesome... Now where do they sell those?
