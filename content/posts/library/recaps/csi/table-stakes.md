## Synopsis

An elite fund-raising party at a legendary showgirl's elegant Las Vegas mansion turns deadly in a twist-filled episode. Grissom, Catherine, Sara and Nick investigate when the body of a leggy brunette is discovered floating in the mansion's pool. Their suspicions soon focus on the brash couple, Patrick and Amanda Haynes, who hosted the party and are house-sitting for the absent owner. They claim the former entertainer, now a wealthy older woman, is vacationing in Europe and can't be reached, but the CSI team isn't so sure. Also, Warrick combs for clues when a man is gunned down, possibly by a hit man, in a glass hotel elevator.

## Review

Sara gets woken up on her day off (her first in three weeks) and gets called in. Sara's just a bit cranky and tired, evidencing this with a large yawn. Sara and Nick give instructions to Greg (she 'hates' him because he's awake).

Sara perks up at Nick's offer of a steak and egg breakfast, but then Greg comes in and informs them that the DNA they submitted matches a cold case from Texas. Sara discovers that the suspect's Social Security number is actually that of a dead infant -- and then glares at Nick when he asks her if she's sure.

Sara, Nick and Catherine are discussing the case (and dating in general), Nick explains the pinholed check to Sara.

Sara, Nick, Catherine and Brass have lunch in a restaurant as they discuss the case. Sara and Nick 'go Dutch' on their part of the check (referencing their earlier conversation about dating).

## Notes

* Sara is _not_ a happy camper when she's woken on her day off.
* Sara has a 'chickenscratch' signature.
* Sara eating fish despite having gone vegetarian in the earlier episode -- however, it's not mentioned that Grissom's pig experiment was what made her go vegetarian until the episode "Face Lift". Some vegetarians do eat fish.
* Additional note: in a later interview, Jorja Fox was told that the Chilean sea bass is a rare species; she said that she wished she had known that for this episode.
