A ratings juggernaut like "CSI" hardly needs the help of a rabid fan campaign. But after news that "CSI" star Jorja Fox would be quitting the show, Internet crazies started rallying together to keep her fighting TV crime.

So far, online group Dollarforsense.com has deluged CBS's offices with whack-job gifts in the hopes of keeping Fox's character, Sara Sidle, on the show. So far, their stunts have stopped just short of being mistaken as the calling cards of one of "CSI"'s rotating cast of psycho killers. They've hired planes to fly "Keep Jorja Fox on "CSI"" messages over CBS studios, stuffed execs' offices with balloons and inexplicably sent off 192 chocolate-covered insects.

The crux of their efforts, though, revolves around a letter-writing campaign encouraging fans to mail dollar bills to the show's writers and producers. At press time, nearly $10,000 US was awaiting delivery. Curiously, the campaign isn't addressing the cash to Fox herself, who's leaving the show after being reportedly unable to wrangle a sweet enough contract. Ah well, surely the "CSI" staff will appreciate the year's worth of free frappuccinos.
