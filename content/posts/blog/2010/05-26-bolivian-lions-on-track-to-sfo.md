But it looks like the lions are well on their way to freedom.  The ADI reports <a href="http://adirescuediary.com/2010/05/25/rescue-diary-day-6/">they have a flight for the lions</a>.  They want the early morning flight, so we'll have to wait and hope they get it! Earlier would be better for the lions, given the heat!

Jorja had a bit to say about all the delays:

<blockquote>CSI actress, Jorja Fox, who is with the ADI team in San Francisco waiting to greet the lions said, “We had planned for the lions to come on Monday but that fell through because of a problem with the lifting gear for the crates at Cochabamba airport. That is just one of the headaches. We’ve had to contend with the Icelandic volcano, strikes, riots, all manner of logistical difficulties, mountains of paperwork, and even a Presidential visit at our arrival airport. I will just be so relieved when we see these lions roll off the aircraft. Then, on Friday it will be truly wonderful seeing them walk free in their new enclosure, to feel the grass beneath their feet for the first time ever.”

[...]

Fox added, “What a way to start memorial weekend. These lions that lived for years in a tiny, rusty cage on the back of a truck, really are home for the holidays.”
