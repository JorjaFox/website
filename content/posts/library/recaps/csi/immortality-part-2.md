## Synopsis

_The episode continues from [Immortality (Part 1)](/library/recaps/csi/immortality-part-1/)_

Unlike the last time Grissom was mentioned in the lab , this time everyone is angry at Grissom because of Lady Heather. However they allow him in the room when Heather is interrogated.

She claims there was an intruder in her home whom she attacked and then ran off, not calling the cops because of recent experiences. Heather needles Sara until Sara breaks and leaves the room, promising to get Heather. It's Heather who says 'you mean him', indicating Grissom. Heather explains that while she's certainly the 'cause' for the killings, she's not behind them. She's being framed by one of the thirteen people who had a key to her special room.

Of the thirteen people, only five are male and alive. They include Dalton Barrow, Heather's first client. But none of their blood matches. As they mull that over, Lindsey Willows brings in Grissom's suitcase. Only it's not Grissom's. It's a dead body in a suitcase. In the body is a MicroSD card with a video message for Grissom. All the killings are being done for him.

The body is identified as Jacob Wolfowitz, the man who killed Heather's daughter. While they manage to clear Heather as the person in the video, she's still detained as a suspect while the CSIs hunt down more evidence, but all they find is Mr. Synthetic Cadaver with a bee in him.

Grissom and Sara study the bee, which Grissom thinks was planted just for him. He sends out sniffer bees to find the where the bee in the fake body came from, and hopefully find the killer: Dalton Barron.

Meanwhile D.B. Russell tracks down the prints from the cadaver and sends Catherine, Greg, and Morgan Brody off to collect the man: Dalton Barron. The trio don't make it out there, finding bombs in their cars instead. Catherine is able to help everyone defuse the car bombs safely.

Dalton's entire apartment is wired to blow, and as Grissom and Sara find him in the forest, so is he. Somehow he managed to trick them with his DNA. Since Dalton is dying of lymphoma, the blood he left at the scene matches his stem cell treatment, not his bucal swab. Dalton's motive was because Grissom ruined Heather, taking her away from him. Grissom is able to talk him into delaying, disconnecting his suicide vest.

As the case closes, Russell leaves for the Cyber team while Catherine returns to Las Vegas and Sara gets the Director's position. Grissom heads back out to the ocean and Heather is free to go. Before she does, Grissom thanks Heather for opening his heart so he could love.

As Sara leaves for San Diego, she leaves her director's badge for Catherine. In the end, she chooses Grissom.

**End of Series**

## Review

Sara is anything but happy to see Heather, and blows up at Grissom. She keeps it together until the interrogation, and has to leave then. Catherine calls her out on still being in love with Grissom, but admits she herself would like to kill Heather too. Heather asks Sara if she loves Grissom, and Sara admits she still does.

While still smarting over Heather, Sara apologizes to Grissom and asks if they can be friends, to which he agrees. They work on the bees together, just like old times.

In the end, Sara gets the position she wants but refuses to say goodbye to Grissom. They're two ships passing in the night. When Grissom thanks Heather, he says his heart belongs to one woman, meaning Sara, she hears all but the end. Meaning she doesn't know that until she reads the transcript of Heather's final interview with Grissom.

And she gives it all up for Grissom, sailing off into the ocean with him.

## Notes

* Sara is promoted to Lab Director (the role Grissom had in season one)
* Sara chooses Grissom in the end.

## Quotes

**Sara** Lady Heather, as much as I'd like to roll out the voluntary red carpet and welcome you here to your own bombing party, I can't find it in my bone marrow to overrule my gut. But I'm sure you're having a blast with the blasts, so I'll just ask the question... are you the one behind the bombings?\
**Lady Heather** Your hostility connotes jealousy and resentment. It doesn't suit you, Sara.\
**Sara** Mrs. Sidle to you.\
**Lady Heather** Ms. Sidle, isn't it?

- - -

**Lady Heather** Do you love him?\
**Sara** I do.
