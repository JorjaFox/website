On yesterday's episode of "CSI" ("Leave Out All the Rest"), recently departed CSI Sara Sidle sends Gil Grissom a .mov file -slash- Dear John "letter" over the internets. Look closely, and you can briefly see her email address flash across the screen: info@seashepherd.org. ZOMG! Sara is sailing with the crew of the [Sea Shepherd Conservation Society](http://www.seashepherd.org/)!

Of her adventure with Captain Paul Watson and his band of anti-whaling pirates, Sara says,

Hello from below the equator, in Puerto Ayora. We’ve been at sea for over a month now. Man, you wouldn’t believe the crew - students, activists, scientists - the dinner conversations alone are mindblowing. And there’s even this marine biologist that reminds me a little bit of you. I wish that we could talk in person but this is the best that I can do. I want to apologize for being out of touch. I’ve been thinking about us a lot, though, all the moments. I thought we could survive anything. This trip has given me a lot of clarity. That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone think but now, for the first time in a really long time, I’m happy.

When actress Jorja Fox - the vegetarian and PETA supporter who plays Sara Sidle - left "CSI" last season, I was afraid it would be the end of "CSI**s animal-friendly plotlines. In the past, they've dealt with canned hunting involving discarded zoo animals, dog fighting, factory farming and chicken slaughter, and Sara's vegetarianism, of course. The show has been honored by the HSUS's Genesis Awards for its compassionate storylines; in a multi-episode plotline, Danny Bonaduce played an aging rock star/animal welfare crusader, who targeted said slaughterhouse in a PETA-like PSA.

Given that Jorja Fox is the high-profile veg*n on "CSI**s set, I assumed that she was the driving force behind these stories. I wonder whether she managed to convert any of her co-workers, or if one/some of the writers also just happen to be interested in animal advocacy on their own?

Either way, I think it's totally awesome that Sara Sidle has defected - from Crime Scene Investigator to international, sea-faring, anti-whaling, activist-pirate-terrorist. Welcome to the dark green side, Sara. Just be careful who you extend your vegan potluck invites to.

Keep up with Sara and the crew through [Whale Wars](http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/), now airing on Animal Planet (Fridays at 9PM).
