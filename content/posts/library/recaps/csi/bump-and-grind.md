## Synopsis

A man is forced to eat a soup consisting of a credit card and his own ear, before being tossed into a landfill shredder, where his oozing remains are called into the police. The find the credit card bits, along with the body, and trace it back to Larry LaMotte, an identity theft expert who runs the company I.D.-Preserve. Larry is not, however dead (nor is he the face of his company, a man in the mail room 'plays' him on TV), nor are his credit cards missing.

The body also shows sign of being shot, but the bullet is old enough that it's actually been in the body for a while. Also almost all the trash found with the body came from bins used by I.D.-Preserve, who happens to sub-contract their disposal to a company co-owned by Julius Kaplan. Kaplan's day job is head of security at I.D.-Preserve. At Julius's house, they find evidence he might be the killer. Of course, he happens to be dead by his pool.

Julius was a former mobster, known as Julius Child, as he used to feed his victims ground up credit cards and casino chips. He, clearly, killed the Shredder Guy, but now the question is 'Who killed Julius?' The partial bullet found in Shredder Guy's head is matched back to the gun used to kill Julius. Shredder Guy is also a John Doe from Reno, who was shot and walked out of the hospital AMA.

Facial recognition determines that Shredder Guy is Larry LaMotte. The *real* Larry LaMotte. The 'TV' Larry stole *his* identity in order to hide his criminal past, and the real Larry was going to take down the whole I.D.-Preserve brand. For that, TV Larry (aka Arlo Karden) had him killed. He had attempted to kill Larry years ago in Reno and failed. When Larry showed back up, he asked for $5-million, which Arlo had Julius pay him. However, Arlo's assistant, Elaine Travers, stole someone's identity and used it to cover her tracks, kill Julius (who did kill Larry), and then stole the money.

## Review

After loosing Rock-Paper-Scissors, Sara gets stuck with picking the body parts out from the garbage, working directly with the body bits and, yet again, Sara ends up with residual dead body smell.  Sara comes up with the idea of checking the bins for blood, which leads them to Julius Kaplan.

Sara, seeing Ray's inner angst over being attacked by Nate Haskell, and reminds him that everything, the good and the bad, go into making us who we are, but we don't have to let it define us. We get to define that.

## Notes

* Sara commiserates with Hodges over his unrequited love.
* Sara tries to connect with Ray.
