<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/06/janevaldez-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="janevaldez" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2473" />  Jane Velez-Mitchell takes a stand on some of the most emotionally charged _ISSUES_ of the day. On Friday, she took the time to talk to Jorja about the recent lion rescue, highlighting the abuse these poor animals received in the circus. It's great to see the news picking up on this, so more people become aware of how archaic the circus has become.

As Jorja says:
<blockquote>The unfortunate truth about zoos and circuses is that they're cruel, they're arcane, they are not suitable places for animals, especially large wild animals. I think we've evolved beyond them. I think there's a lot of people out there who realize in the same way that we've evolved beyond asbestos and lead paint that we're now at a place in our evolution where we can say, you know what, this is not a compassionate thing, this is not a smart thing. It's a waste of resources and it's a waste of these animals' lives.</blockquote>
