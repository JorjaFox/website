As we're all about Jorja here, the show only gets two, but it was still a good episode. Would watch again.

Amusing fact: Sara likes Radiohead. Also I love that shirt and I think I need to go find it.

What? Oh, something something Sinatra.

I still don't have working cable TV, but as you can tell, I got a better quality of video this time, so the screencaps are nice and big. Yes, my furniture (mostly) arrived. Half my bed is missing, and I'm probably going to have to get a new slats for my frame. Yaaaay. Tonight, we sleep on the mattress on the floor, and I don't even care.
