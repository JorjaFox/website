Jorja Fox once starred as a rooster in the children's classics Chicken Little. She was five years old and liked being on stage so much that she became fixated on an acting career. Three decades down the track and New York City-born Fox,36, now ranks among the most popular TV actors in the US. The rooster role, she says, will never be reprised. "I dropped out of the play, actually," a giggling Fox told TV Guide in Los Angeles. "I did a great rooster."

Fox has had guest roles in TV dramas The West Wing and ER and starred in 2000 film, Memento, with Guy Pearce. Her current popularity has been built on her penchant for microscopes, disposal gloves and tweezers while playing no-nonsense forensic investigator Sara Sidle in hit whodunit drama series CSI:Crime Scene Investigation. Still, staring in a top-rating drama is never something this actor takes for granted. "We really have an appreciation for just how fantastically impossible this is, and to appreciate it every day," she says. "I feel so deeply blesses. Who knows how long we'll be in this moment." Regular viewers will have tapped into the unresolved nature of the relationship between Sara and William Petersen's senior CSI, Grissom, who brought her to Vegas initially to watch his back and challenge her co-workers. "Sara went into season four (currently on NINE) heartbroken and a little protective, a littler bitter and also quite fearless about certain things. "I don't think she'll chase Grissom - and I don't think the dance between Grissom and Sara is over. The ball is definitely in his court." In her down time from CSI, Fox devotes herself to an independant avante-garde theatre company she co-founded in LA and says her eventual aim is to become a producer.
