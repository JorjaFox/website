**The actress rejoins the crime procedural as a full-time cast member for its upcoming 12th season.**

"CSI" is officially welcoming back a familiar face.

"The Hollywood Reporter" has confirmed that former series regular -- and recent guest star - Jorja Fox will appear full-time on the CBS crime procedural, as first reported by TV Line.

Fox first appeared as Sara Sidle on "CSI" in Season 1 and departed early in Season 8. She returned as a guest star the following season and has remained billed as such through last season.

**Ted Danson** joins the veteran series' 12th season as its new team leader -- replacing **Laurence Fishburne** -- and also see the drama move from its longtime Thursday night time slot to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. beginning Sept. 21.

Series creator **Anthony Zuiker** also swapped studios from his longtime home at CBS to ABC Studios.
