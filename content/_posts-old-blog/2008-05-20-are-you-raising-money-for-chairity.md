Since Jorja gives a lot to various charities, and many of her fans do the same, I thought it'd be appropriate to share what the community does here. Are you raising money or supporting a cause? Let us know by commenting or emailing us and we'll put you in our rotating charity header to share with the world!

<ul>
<li>JAA is raising money for Burma (through the end of this month, so don't forget).</li>
<li>JFO is raising money for Animal Acres (through end of June, it's not too late).</li>
</ul>
