Thanks to Shane for finding this!  God knows when or where it aired, but it did.

I'm not a George fan, but his response to what it was like to work with Bieber had me guffawing.  And Jorja was cute.  Jorja's joke about how they were going to get married if they reached a certain age and were unattached was cute.  Nice to see they're friends!
