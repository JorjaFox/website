<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/10/susanGKomen-logo.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/10/susanGKomen-logo-100x100.jpg" alt="susanGKomen-logo" title="susanGKomen-logo" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2062" /></a> You're not crazy. There's a page peal in that upper right hand corner that links you to the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G Komen for the Cure Foundation</a> website.

Susan G. Komen died of breast cancer, and her sister started the foundation to help end the disease.  Six years ago, Jorja was the spokesperson for the foundation, and other CSI stars have done the same.   You can follow them on <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/AboutUs/KomenSocialNetworking.html">many social media sites</a> , including <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=14084625156">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/komenforthecure">Twitter</a>.

Remember, breast cancer can affect anyone, male or female.  Everyone should give themselves a <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/BreastSelfExam.html">Breast Self-Exam</a> and, if you're high risk, get a mammogram.  It saved my uncle's life.  My grandmother lost one breast to cancer, and my good friend lost both while her sister had a lumpectomy.  Breast cancer can't be prevented. Yet.  But you can make your chances for survival much higher.
