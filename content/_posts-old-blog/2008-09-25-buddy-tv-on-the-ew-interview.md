It's pretty much a rehash of the transcript provided from yours truly, so nothing ground-breaking.  Except for this strange tidbit (I've bolded the relevant part):

<blockquote>"I'll be visiting a little bit," the <b>newly engaged Fox</b> said.  "I'll be in and out, and it's kind of fun. I knew that might happen.  I didn't know it was going to happen so soon, so it was a surprise.  It's always a surprise, really, and it's been really great.  It's been great to be there."</blockquote>

To put it eloquently: Bwuh? That's certainly news to me. I'm inclined to think it's a typo.
