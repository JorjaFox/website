Zuiker's back on CSI and he's going to be tweeting/spoiling us about CSI every day! But he isn't the only source of joy. David Rambo is back! So here's what we know from this week in CSI:

Tuesday:
> Ok fans! Tomorrow is Day One of the development of the 2-hour finale. I will be giving you updates until we air. <a href="http://t.co/P2sKZZnrj2">pic.twitter.com/P2sKZZnrj2</a></p>
> — Anthony E. Zuiker (@zuiker) <a href="https://twitter.com/zuiker/status/603028225501962240">May 26, 2015</a>

and

> This pretty much sums it up, CSI fans. A rare photo of Billy Petersen with you know who in the b.g. Finale "Day 1." <a href="http://t.co/Dl2673knAY">pic.twitter.com/Dl2673knAY</a>
> — Anthony E. Zuiker (@zuiker) <a href="https://twitter.com/zuiker/status/603199353147162624">May 26, 2015</a>


Wednesday:

> Day 1 of development for the 2-hour finale was very promising. Mum on details but there could be a clue in each post <a href="http://t.co/8oQwQbcCRH">pic.twitter.com/8oQwQbcCRH</a>

Friday:

Liz Devine posted on Facebook, when asked about not making GSR all flashbacks:

> Cannot reveal any details but you know we have Billy for the movie. We wouldn't waste him solely on flashbacks.

Eric Szmanda <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/csi_actor_eric_szmanda_on_star.html">was interviewed</a> and asked about what he'd like to see for Greg in the finale:

> "15 years of Greg pursuing other interests in the romantic world, it would be nice to see Greg with someone by the end of the run," he said. "He had a thing for Sara and Sara went for Grissom instead. Another girl ended up dead, another one ended up in jail. It would make me feel good."

I'll be posting these once a week to keep us up to date.
