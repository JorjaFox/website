If you were a little interested in where in the world is Sara Sidle, you're not alone.  The [Sea Shepherd Conservation Society](https://www.seashepherd.org) are often affectionately called 'anti-whaling pirates.'  Also check out [easyVegan.info](https://www.easyvegan.info/2008/11/07/sara-sidle-from-csi-to-terra-ist/), who are rather happy to see Sara turn 'terra-ist.'
