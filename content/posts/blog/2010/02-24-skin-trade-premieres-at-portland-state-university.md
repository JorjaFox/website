Saturday, February 27th 2010 at 7:30 in the Smith Memorial Union, Multicultural Center Room 238, PSU will be airing "Skin Trade", so if you're in the area, rev up the car, go watch it, and come back and tell us how it was!

From the press-release:

<blockquote>From the director of the multi-award-winning documentary film “Behind the Mask” comes the new documentary the fur industry doesn’t want you to see. “Skin Trade” takes the viewer on a journey from the birth of fur used for trading between Native Americans and Europeans, to the exploitation of animals and fur for fashion.

The film delves into the corruption and lies perpetrated by fashion designers that claim their fur designs are “eco-friendly” as well as those retailers and fur farmers who claim that the animals are killed humanely.

With a pulsating soundtrack by Duran Duran and The Faded, Skin Trade is sure to motivate and inspire designers, celebrities and consumers to stop buying fur and start taking a stand. Featuring John Feldmann, Jorja Fox, James Cromwell, Rikki Rockett, William McNamara, Todd Oldham, Ingrid Newkirk, and more!

PLUS! After the movie there will be a discussion with Portland Anti-Fur Activists on current campaigns and upcoming anti-fur events that YOU can join!
