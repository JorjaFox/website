<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/06/considerjorja.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/06/considerjorja-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="considerjorja" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1899" /></a> I want to remind everyone that this is the <strong>big</strong> ballot.  This is NOT the final list at all, so the fact that Jorja's listed just means she put her name in the ring.  The final nominations will be listed in July, so until then, we're at 'For your consideration...'

Of course this does mean I urge all of you on twitter to use the '#considerjorja' hashtag and try and get her noticed!
