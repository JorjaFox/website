Marg's last day of filming was December 6th.  As of today, she's no longer a cast member on <em>CSI</em>, after 260 episodes and 11 and a half years.
<blockquote>Jorja Fox, who left the series in Season 8 only to return soon after, tells us she is still holding out hope that Marg will return just as she did. "I lovingly call this job The Hotel California," Jorga laughs. "There's a line in the song that says you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave, and I've made that joke to her several times in the last couple of weeks. I'm like, 'you'll be back'… I believe that in my heart of hearts. I think it makes it easier to say goodbye to her right now because in my heart she'll be back at some point, some time."</blockquote>

There's a teeny bit of Jorja in the video (minutes, folks!):

Marg couldn't make it through the video without crying.

If you can't watch it, here's what Jorja says:
<blockquote>I like to think that I know Marg very well, and she's one of the toughest, most stoic people, forget about 'women' or 'ladies', I mean one of the most stoic <em>people</em> that I've ever met.  And these moments where she's kind of overcome are one in a blue moon.  Probably the last time I ever saw that happen is when her dog died, about six years ago.  She's just ... she's got nerves of steel.  So yeah, it's really overwhelming.  I lovingly call this job the <em>Hotel California</em>.  There's a line in the song that says you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave, and I've made that joke to her several times in the last couple of weeks. I'm like, 'you'll be back, don't worry.'  You're always a part of the team and you're always a part of the family.  I think that-- I believe that in my heart -- I think it makes it easier to say goodbye to her right now because in my heart she'll be back at some point, some time.  Obviously that will be Marg's decision and the writers' decision, and fate will prevail.</blockquote>
Thank you, Marg.
