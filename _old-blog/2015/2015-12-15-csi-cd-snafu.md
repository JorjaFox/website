SNAFU means 'Situation Normal, All F***ed Up.'

And that's the best way I can think of to describe what's going on with the DVDs of the CSI Finale.

I know they're not even supposed to be out until the 23rd, but Amazon has started delivering. A handful of people were very exicted to get their DVDs and hopefully watch the director's cut (or notes, or the cut scenes). But instead of getting a lovely one-disc with all the glory, they got the first disc from Season 15.

Whoops!

Please contact Amazon ASAP if this happens to you.

In the meantime, here's the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/video/tv/immortality-final-scene/">last few scenes from Immortality</a>. You know the ones:
