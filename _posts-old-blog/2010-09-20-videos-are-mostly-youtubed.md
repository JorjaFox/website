While I'd much rather host it all internally, frankly, the choice was YouTube or pay for (a) a bigger host package or (b) video hosting.  So we're on YouTube. The exceptions are videos which, due to copyright issues, cannot be on YouTube.  Keep in mind, since I've only ever offered small, short, clips, we should actually be okay legally under 'fair use.'  I'm not attempting to show you the whole movie/tv show, just small excerpts to entice you to _legally_ acquire these things.

Think of it this way. If you steal, Jorja doesn't get paid!

All videos are linked off <a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos">JFO TV</a> and are now embeddable, so you can use them wherever you want.  If a video _is not_ on YouTube, there's a reason, so please just direct people to this site to view it. Thanks!
