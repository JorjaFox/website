## Summary

A girl and her father are brought into the ER after a car accident. Her father abandons her in the ER, and he is the only match for her rare blood type. This forces Benton to operate on her without blood and Carter and Lucy to travel all through the city to find the father. They encounter a number of obstacles including Carter dislocating his shoulder, and end up across the street from the hospital.

## Review

Doyle works on the girl while she's in the ER.
