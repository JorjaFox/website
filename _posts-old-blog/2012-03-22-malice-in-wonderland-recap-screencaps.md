Boy you guys are harsh! This is the first time I really felt bad for TPTB about how they handle Grissom and Sara. If they do nothing, everyone's mad they didn't say anything. When they do something, handling it quietly like the used to in the early seasons, it's not enough.Â Given that this is a crime show, and relationships exist only to further the crime (like Hodges' mom), the fact we get any non-plot related comments about GSR is amazing. Think about it. Any time we got Catherine's personal life, it was for plot. Now we get Sara (and DB, oddly) who have relationships, it impacts them but not the plot, as we get little tidbits of non-work things. That's pretty cool.

Also? A plant, man!
