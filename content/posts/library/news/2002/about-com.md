**Are you surprised at the popularity of the show and the amount of young people who are going to college now to learn more about forensics?**

JORJA FOX: I'm enormously surprised at the success of ?C.S.I.? I think that even in all of our wildest dreams that we could have imagined as great a run as we are having and I'm just thrilled about it. I feel blessed every day. I'm also surprised that, yes, there seems to be an increase in kids wanting to study forensics.

I know that the big joke right now is with law enforcement, when they talk to people, everybody thinks that they can have their crime solved in 40 minutes or at least less than two days. Unfortunately, that's the key to our show. We're hearing about that right now and it'll be interesting to see if the kids stick to it or if it's something that looks more glossy than it is perhaps on a day-to-day basis.

**How has the reaction been within the law enforcement community? Do you hear mostly positive responses?**

JORJA FOX: Yes, for the most part everybody is very, very supportive. It's really a great thing. We try very hard to make the show as real as we can. Time is the only place where we really take big cheats. We thought about opening a case in September and we'll solve it in December - like real-life - but we thought we might lose some of our audience then.

**What's it like joining a show that's so successful?**

ARCHIE KAYO: It's so exciting.

**Is it a little bit intimidating joining one of the highest rated shows on television?**

ARCHIE KAYO: Yes, there's no question. I think it's certainly a genuine privilege. Besides the show being so well done, everyone on the show is a class act. Everyone is realizing that it is kind of an extraordinary ride and they are all aware.

JORJA FOX: Basically we are all loony and down-to-earth.

**Is it really crazy behind-the-scenes? It's such a serious drama.**

JORJA FOX: Yeah, we cut loose.

ARCHIE KAYO: You couldn't imagine.

**Who is the practical joker?**

JORJA FOX: I think probably George Eads is the biggest practical joker. But everybody is fair game and everybody has jokes that they like to play on each other.

**This movie tonight - "The Emperor's Club" - is basically about teachers and the impact they have on their students. Did you have a teacher who made an impact on you?**

JORJA FOX: Yes, several. I am specifically thinking right now about a high school English teacher, Mrs. Williamson, and a high school Humanities teacher, Mrs. Asher.

**Was it what they taught you or how they taught you?**

JORJA FOX: Both, I think. They were really accessible to all the kids in the school, for the most part. It didn't matter if you were doing well in the class or if you were doing poorly in the class, they kept an eye on everybody in addition to just inspiring kids. For me, I never loved Shakespeare or traditional English studies; I like modern stuff. For a teacher to get me really excited about Shakespeare to a point where you are passionate about it - you can't wait to read the next chapter - that shows dedication.

ARCHIE KAYO: I had an English Composition teacher in college who I think I really, really looked up to. I thought so much of him as a professor, he was so inspirational, that I actually wanted to be him when I graduated. So I went to talk to him and I said, ?I want to teach.? He said, ?Archie, I really admire that, I think it's noble, but I think you should go live your life and then come back and you'll have more to teach.? At first I was offended, but now I realize how right he really was.

**Have you called him since you started acting to let him know he was right?**

ARCHIE KAYO: (Laughing) I can't find him. I've been looking for him but I don't know where he's gone.
