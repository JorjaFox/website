## Synopsis

Catherine, Nick, and Sara investigate a seemingly months old body found in the mountains. Discovery of the man's identity lead the team to the world of robot wars. Warrick and Grissom look into the case of a man found murdered in an alley. Complicating their efforts, the medical examiner 'lost' the body for 11 days. Greg helps this case by doing some undercover work.

## Review

Nick has apparently heard about Sara's breakup with Hank, and tries to set her up with his buddy; she firmly rejects the idea. Sara and Nick work with Catherine on the 'soap mummy' case -- Sara traces the ring found in the barrel to an engineering honor society, and later links the ring with the victim's buddy. Sara and Nick strip down the various bots, and discover blood on parts from different bots -- blood that traces back to the victim. Sara and Nick reassemble the victim's bot -- Sara stretches out and hesitantly switches it on, then pulls back, as if expecting it to jump.

## Notes

* Sara rejects Nick's offer to set her up with his buddy.
* Once again Sara shows her mechanical skills, when she helps Nick first strip down and then reassemble the bots.
