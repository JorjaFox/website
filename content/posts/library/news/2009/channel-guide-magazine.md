Smile a while, Sara Sidle lovers!

CBS announced today that SAG Award winner Jorja Fox will reprise the role on multiple episodes of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION when the show returns for its tenth season September 24.

“We’re thrilled for Jorja’s return to CSI,” said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. “The viewers and longtime CSI fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode.”

Fox, a series regular and fan favorite since the show's first season, left in the midst of Season 8, briefly reappearing in Season 9 as part of the story line that ushered fellow series regular William Petersen -- who starred as Gil Grissom, Sidle’s boss and lover -- to the other side of the series’ cameras to produce and direct.

Nonetheless, dare we be greedy enough to hope that Grissom is there at his lady’s side when she returns, since Petersen said he was not opposed to making guest appearances?

Stay tuned …
