There are a couple of notable departures on television tonight, csistarting Jorja Fox's last regular appearance as Sara Sidle on "CSI" (9 p.m., CBS).

As you may already know, Fox -- who has had a sometimes contentious relationship with the folks who produce the series -- decided to bow out of the "CSI" world earlier this year, giving the writers a chance to prepare a proper farewell to an important character. I wouldn't be surprised if Fox resurfaces some time in the future but, at least for now, her days as a regular are over.

Sara, Gil Grissom's (Will Petersen) protege-turned-lover, exits in a particularly moody and quite good episode that resurrects a troubling old case (remember the manipulative and creepy child genius-murderer Hannah West from last season? Well, she's back.)

It's a proper send-off and one you shouldn't miss if you're a fan of the show.
