<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5502" title="JoshRHeadshot" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/10/JoshRHeadshot-276x140.jpeg" alt="" width="276" height="140" />Josh Randall used to be on Ed, and he and the titular character had an ongoing '$10 Bet' where they'd bet each other to do things like call a priest 'Padre' or order dinner only by saying 'Burger me.'

He's also playing 'Doug' on CSI, a recurring charatcer who "shares a history with Sara" (per <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2012/10/csi-taps-josh-randall-for-recurring-role/">CSI Files's latest news</a>).
<blockquote>Randall will first appear in this season’s tenth installment, “Risky Business Class,” tentatively scheduled to be the last episode to air in 2012. In the episode–which kicks off an arc for the actor–he’ll play NTSB investigator Doug, a guy’s guy who is good at his job. He shares a history with Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**), which resurfaces when he’s in town to head up a plane crash investigation.  A former colleague of Sara’s from San Francisco, Doug finds himself still attracted to the now married CSI, but that doesn’t stop him from wanting to take a friendly trip down memory lane. **Elizabeth Devine** wrote the episode, which is now in its second day of filming under the direction of **Frank Waldeck**.</blockquote>
You know what? I'm not at all opposed to him in this role.

Forgot about this? It came up a little while ago in the post <a title="CSI Spoilers Spark Terror…" href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/csi-spoilers-spark-terror/">CSI Spoilers Spark Terror…</a>
