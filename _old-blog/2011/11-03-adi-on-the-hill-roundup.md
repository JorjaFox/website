Images are up in the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/adi/20111102-adihill/">ADI on the Hill Gallery</a> for starters. Thanks everyone for the links to even more photos! I'm adding them as I get them (there are some <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/search/Search.aspx?eventid=131319930">Getty Images</a>, but they're not publicly released).

There are bunch of official ADI videos, but they're pretty bad quality.  I'm hoping C-SPAN comes up with one (they normally do if they managed to tape this at all).

Then we have some quotes:
<blockquote>Known to 73million CSI viewers as Sara Sidle, today Jorja Fox said: _“It is time to say that elephants should not be kept in chains nor lions, tigers, bears and monkeys in small cages on the backs of trucks. This Bill has the potential to eradicate considerable animal suffering and I believe it will be embraced by Americans.”_</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Congress has a responsibility to protect the welfare of animals and ensure public safety. A prohibition on the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses is proportionate, responsible, the least expensive solution to this problem, and long overdue.

We call on Congress to bring to an end, once and for all, the abuse and suffering that has been exposed by ADI time and time again.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun and I think we can do more for our kids by doing the compassionate thing and the respectful thing. If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they would actually be very disappointed in us for bringing them to these places," Fox said on the Hill Wednesday morning.</blockquote>

Let's hope this bill passes!  If you're an American Citizen, you can help!  Write your Congressman and ask them to vote to protect animals.
