For eight seasons of "**CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"**, William Petersen has played Gil Grissom [...] The 55-year-old theater veteran talks to "TV Guide" about the hit show, his character and what happens now co-star Jorja Fox has left.

[...]

**What did you think of [Grissom's] relationship with Sara (Jorja Fox)?**

It's really worked for Jorja Fox and me to play Sara Sidle and Grissom and have this sort of adult relationship. This has been an interesting study of adult male-female relationship in the workplace. We never made it blatant. We never made it cheap. They had an affair, but they kept it private because it would have changed the dynamic of the whole workplace, and their careers. They did the right thing for each other. They weren't cheating on anybody else.

**So how do you feel about Jorja leaving the show?**

Jorja's character went the right way. I think that's all any of us want. When you play a character for a while, you really care for the character. Jorja loved Sara Sidle as I love Grissom. I think she was very satisfied with the way the storyline evolved for her and for Sara Sidle. But we haven't seen the last of Sara Sidle either, you know!

**So what more are we going to see of her?**

I can't really tell you because it would be unfair to the show and the audience. But just because you leave a movie or a show doesn't mean you can't come back. All I know is we want to maintain the integrity of the show throughout, whatever happens to Grissom and Sara.
