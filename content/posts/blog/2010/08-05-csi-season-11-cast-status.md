CBS published their press release for Season 11 up on CBS PressExpress.  Since only people in the US can see that, here's a copy of the relevant bit:
<blockquote>**STARRING:**

Marg Helgenberger...................... Catherine Willows
Laurence Fishburne...............Dr. Raymond Langston
George Eads...................................... Nick Stokes
Paul Guilfoyle................................Capt. Jim Brass
Eric Szmanda...................................Greg Sanders
Robert David Hall...................... Dr. Albert Robbins
David Berman.................................David Phillips
Wallace Langham............................David Hodges
</blockquote>

You may notice that Jorja's name _is not_ listed.  And yet I did just post photos of her on set!  What does that mean?  It means we're back to special guest/recurring status for another season.  Thankfully, we still have that email list I made up: CSI Watch.

CSI Watch is an **announcement only** email list and I use it to send you reminders when episodes with Jorja are going to air.  Any emails you send to the list are automatically deleted, so don't worry about spam.
