CBS announced today it has given a series order to CSI: VEGAS, the sequel to the Network’s global hit “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” one of the most-watched drama series of the 21st century. Original “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox will reprise their roles as Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, respectively.
