**Pizza to die for**

Jorja Fox sees dead people - but that's her job. As forensic crime scene investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, she determines the cause of death by examining evidence with high-tech toys. Forensic science allows the dead to communicate with the living and producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made it chic to be a science geek.

What viewer see each week, such as the path of a bullet travelling through a human body could put anyone off eating meat. Maybe we should take a tip from Fox and become vegetarians, which she's been for over 15 years.

And her favorite dish? "Pizza, Always pizza. I think I've been a pizza fanatic my whole life. It started in New York city, cause you could get dough from a lot of pizza shops there", says Fox.

There's no need to knead, however, when you can beg, borrow or deal to your hands on the dough. "I actually get the crust from one of my favorite pizza joints in L.A.... they sell it to me in a little ball", the actress says.

Fox takes her goods home where she employs simple cooking method to devour the evidence. "[Because] I'm a vegetarian, I make [my pizza] with soy pepperoni and sausage, and soy cheese, Cilantro and pineapple is my favorite, with a little veggie sausage."

But be careful - that combination could be used as a lethal weapon.

Vegetarian Pizza with Pineapple and Pepperoni

1 12 inch (30 cm) pizza round

1 cup/250 ml pizza sauce or salsa

2 cups/500 ml pineapple tidbits, fresh or canned, well drained

1 pkg (4.2 oz/120 g sliced soy pepperoni, or amount to taste

1/4 cup /50 ml fresh cilantro, chopped

2 cups/500 ml soy cheese, shredded

Fox prefers to buy the pizza dough from her favorite pizza shop and sometimes uses soy sausage instead of soy pepperoni. Pour pizza sauce over pizza round and spread evenly. Arrange pineapple and pepperoni slices to taste on and sprinkle with cilantro and shredded cheese. Bake in the lower half of a 450 F (230 C) oven for 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Makes 1 12-inch (30 cm) pizza.
