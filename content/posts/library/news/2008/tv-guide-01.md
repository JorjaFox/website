**Question: What happened to Catherine finding the picture of Grissom and Sara that was teased all week? That scene sure wasn't in the "CSI" I watched on Thursday! - Kathy**

**Ausiello:** Good question - let's ask exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. "The scene where Catherine finds Sara's picture on Grissom's fridge is really fun. But the paradox of writing a procedural is that sometimes even our favorite scenes (scenes that show the personal lives of our CSIs) aren't required by the narrative. We wrote the scene because, like Catherine, we're dying to snoop around Grissom and Sara's relationship. But at the end of the day, crime-solving trumped romance. The scene drove our hearts, but not our investigation." However, Mendelsohn tells me that she was "so charmed by the scene" that she went and posted it on the Internets! Even better, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nyTQBE7vCI)!

**Question: OMG, was Grissom talking to Sara on the phone at the end of Thursday's episode? Is Jorja coming back to the show next season?- Shannen**

**Ausiello:** I'll let Mendelsohn tackle the first part of that question: "To everyone who's pondered, 'Who is Grissom talking to in the final scene?' - well, her photo was on his fridge." (Look - the screen-grabbed proof!) For an answer to the second part, you'll have to watch my new Ausiello Report vodcast.
