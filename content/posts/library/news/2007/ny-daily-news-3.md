Jorja Fox has confirmed the talk: She has quit "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."

"There are all these things I want to do," the 39-year-old actress told EW.com yesterday. "Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old. If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would've tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like it's going to be around for a while; if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by, have to get off the ride for a while."

Fox was fired in 2004 for not showing up on time on the set after tense contract negotiations, but was rehired after settling pay increase issues.

When Fox's contract expired in May, CBS invited her back for the eighth season, but she only signed for half the season. Her last episode will air in November.
