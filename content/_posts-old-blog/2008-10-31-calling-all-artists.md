I suck at art!  There, I said it.  And sadly, that means most of our 'link back to JFO' images? Kinda suck too.  I mean really, have you seen them?  Some of those animated ones are just terribly 1999! 

So we're starting over.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/link-back">Linky images have a new home</a>, and we're stumping for new ones!  If you're good at that sort of thing, and if you're bored, please consider bailin' a sister out!  Post links to your graphics in this thread, or email them to webmaster @ jorjafox.net for eternal gratitude.
