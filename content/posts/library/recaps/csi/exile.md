## Synopsis

Cuban singing sensation Silvana is about to make her U.S. debut at Estefan's Vegas nightclub, much to the ire of the Cuban exile community, led by Willie, who considers her a tool of the Cuban government. But when Silvana's sister Marta is tortured, poisoned and killed, it seems that Silvana has also become the target of a vengeful killer. Marta was killed elsewhere and her body brought to Silvana's dressing room, staged in one of her dresses at her vanity.

While Silvana is hugely popular, a large number of protesters are outside her venue: Cuban exiles who wanted her to return to Cuba. Her manager, Antonio Ficha was also her handler, meant to ensure Marta and Silvana don't expatriate and stay in the USA. The leader of the Cuban Exiles, Eddie Santos, was the owner of the shop where Marta was tortured and killed. While his DNA is not a match for that found on the scene, it does match a relative. Eddie's nephew is Estefan Meha, owner of the club where Silvana is performing, and Eddie was tortured by Silvana's father back in Cuba before he escaped to America.

While being beaten, Marta was also poisoned by being force fed casava leaves, a plant that causes cyanotic effects when eaten. When Silvana comes down with the same symptoms (though she was poisoned via pills), and it's determined that Marta had been in contant with a restricted number in Washington DC, it's apparent Marta was considering leaving Cuba for the United States forever and had called seeking asylum. This is, in part, due to Estefan, who was in love with Marta. They met up at Eddie's shop to make love, and Silvana found out and killed her sister.

Marta wanted to come to the US, and to marry Stefan. But Silvana was also in love with Estefan, and killed her sister over that, framed Antonio, and coerced him into killing Estefan by tricking him into thinking Antonio killed Marta.

## Review

Sara works the case and is in somewhat of a hostile mood towards the club owner, who only has functional security cameras aimed at the cash register. This appears to be directly related to the fact that it's women who are being targeted.

## Notes

* Sara is belligerent towards the club owner regarding the safety of the women involved.

## Quotes

**Sara:** If you want this show to go on, you *have* to fix these cameras.

**Sara:** I don't wanna go to that CIA place but ... I'm kinda going to that CIA place.
