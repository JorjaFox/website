**Question:**

I enjoy your column, but I had to throw my two cents in on the
*CSI* romance issue. I think you were hasty in saying that a pairing
would be disastrous. The show already deals with a tremendous amount of
non-case driven material &mdash; just look at how Catherine Willows is
portrayed: single mother (as is mentioned almost every episode), former
stripper, has a murdered, violent ex-husband, her possible father may be a
killer... I think you see my point. *CSI* would never become a soap,
but a relationship between the two most interesting characters (in my
opinion), Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom, could flesh the characters out more
&mdash; when given, as **Anthony Zuiker** has said, in doses. I know I
would love to see it, just as I also love the cases. To me, it is all about
balance, and the show is not balanced right now. We know much more about
Catherine than any other character, and last season seemed too weighed down
by her melodramas. I would love to see more of the rest of the team,
especially Sara Sidle. **Jorja Fox** is a wonderful, radiant actress who
deserves more and better stories, as I think she is vastly underused.
Thanks for letting me rant. I feel better now. &mdash; Michelle

**Matt:**

Glad to oblige. And I should say for the record that after the column
ran noting I had heard more from Grissom-Catherine fans than from
Grissom-Sara fans, the other side weighed in. I was also informed that fan
sites and fan fictions also favor Grissom and Sara. So be it. I just watch
TV, and am rarely able to indulge detours into the deeper depths of online
fandom. I still think *CSI* would be wise parceling out these doses of
implied romance in very small and cautious doses.
