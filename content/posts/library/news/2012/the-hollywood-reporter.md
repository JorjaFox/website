The original cast member has signed a new pact with CBS Television Studios to return to the long-running procedural for its upcoming 13th season.

*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*'s **Jorja Fox **is remaining on the case.

The actress has signed a new one-year deal with CBS Television Studios to remain on the long-running procedural, *The Hollywood Reporter *has learned exclusively.

Fox plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the CBS drama, a role she first stepped into in the second episode of the **Anthony Zuiker** procedural in 2000. The actress, who departed the series as a regular in late 2007, returned in May 2008 as a guest star in a handful of episodes. She was later upped to recurring in 2009 and returned to her role as a series regular in July 2011.

Fox's new deal comes less than two weeks after co-star **George Eads **re-upped with the studio to return for *CSI*'s upcoming 13th season.

Following a tumultuous season that saw the series uprooted from its longtime Thursday time slot to Wednesdays, the billion-dollar franchise saw **Ted Danson **take over for **Laurence Fishburne** at the beginning of the season, later being joined by **Elisabeth Shue**, who replaced **Marg Helgenberger**. **Peri Gilpin** made her debut as the wife to Danson's D.B. Russell during Wednesday's Season 12 finale, which was up a tenth of a point week-over-week with a 2.4 rating in the key adults 18-49 demographic.

Fox is repped by Domain Talent and Framework Entertainment.
