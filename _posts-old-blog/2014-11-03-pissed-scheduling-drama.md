You're not alone! but ... Bitching to me or @csi_cbs or even the lovely @csiwritersroom won't help. What _will_ help is a focused barrage of complaints.

Option 1) Go to <a href="http://audienceservices.cbs.com/feedback/feedback.htm" target="_blank">http://audienceservices.cbs.com/feedback/feedback.htm</a> and tell them how annoyed you are that the show you love is being bumped around.

Option 2) Old school. Send them a letter

Les Moonves
CBS
51 W 52nd St, Suite 35
New York, NY 10019-6119

Nina Tassler
CBS Entertainment
7800 Beverly Blvd.
Los Angeles, CA 90036-2112

I do not advocate emailing Carol Mendelsohn, this isn't something she can fix. In all cases, please remember to be polite.

Oh and yes, I know about the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cbs-move-csi-crime-scene-investigation-back-to-a-weekday">Change.org petition to move CSI back to a weeknight</a>. Go for it, but I promise you a direct barrage works better.
