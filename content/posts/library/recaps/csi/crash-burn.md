## Synopsis

Sara's personal life takes a hit when she investigates a deadly car crash. The accident is a bizarre and seemingly random one involving an elderly woman who killed and injured several people when she drove her car through the front of a bar crowded with happy-hour patrons. Among those hurt is Sara's EMT boyfriend, Hank Peddigrew. While Sara is rocked by his injury at first, she soon manages to work the case in her usual professional manner. Sara's emotions begin to get the best of her once again as she learns disturbing news about Hank's presence in the bar. Elsewhere, a woman dies of carbon-monoxide poisoning, and Grissom quickly decides it was no accident.

## Review

Sara learns that her 'boyfriend', Hank, was cheating on his girlfriend. Except _Sara_ is the other woman, not the girlfriend. This is her second emotional betrayal of the season.

## Notes

* Sara dumps Hank.
