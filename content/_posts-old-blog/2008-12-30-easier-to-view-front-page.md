<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2008/12/kpresenter.png" alt="kpresenter" title="kpresenter" width="64" height="64" style="float:left;padding:5px;" /> Once you get about 100 posts up on a blog, it's hard to sort out what you want from the stuff you don't care about. The way I figure it, most of you care about Jorja Fox.  Then you care about the Jorja Community at large (i.e. yourselves). Finally you may care about the technical things that go on here.

So with that in mind, I've flipped us over to tabs on the front page.  This <strong>only</strong> affects the front page, and as you'll see, the most recent post is still the first one you see, followed by a list of the next 10 posts. Then you get tabs for what matters most to you. I'll probably tweak the layout a little (maybe toss in excerpts <del datetime="2008-12-30T21:53:58+00:00">and dates</del> to that list), but that can come later.
