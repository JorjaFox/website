<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/02/artandath03-100x100.jpg" alt="artandath03" title="artandath03" class="alignleft size-thumb wp-image-1546" /> Every year around this time, <a href="http://AfterEllen.com">AfterEllen.com</a> releases a Hot 100, as selected by lesbians and bisexuals.  And pretty much every year since they've started, Jorja Fox has been on the list. This year does not dissapoint, except perhaps in the distance our star has fallen.  In 2008 she was number 53.  In 2009, she's dropped to #80, which means no perky write-up about how cool she is. But you knew that anyway.

Check out the Hot 100 for yourself. And if you're too lazy to jump to page 15, Jorja's on this page.
