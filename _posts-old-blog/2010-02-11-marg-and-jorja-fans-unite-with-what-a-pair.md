<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/02/MargJorja-WhatAPair-100x100.jpg" alt="Jorja and Marg at What a Pair " title="MargJorja-WhatAPair" width="100" height="100" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2251" /> As announced over on All About Marg (AAM), they're teaming up with JFO's sister site, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/">Jorja All Around</a> (JAA), to raise money for _<a href="http://whatapair.org/">What A Pair!</a>_ and breast cancer research.  While the details are being finalized, AAM and JAA will be offering incentives to donate that both Marg and Jorja fans will be interested in, so this spring, be ready to be delighted.

For me, personally, breast cancer has touched at least one women in every generation on both sides of my family, going back as far as we've got records. My uncle had a breast cancer scare a few years ago, reminding us that even men can get breast cancer. My grandmother calls herself a 'One Tit Wonder', but What A Pair! wants us to sing out and celebrate having both, while raising money to make sure everyone keeps their breasts.

I'm 32 years-old, and I get regular mammograms thanks to having fantastic insurance, but not everyone does.  And frankly, mammograms are as painful as they are expensive.  But we need them.  And until we stop needing them, benefits like What A Pair! are crucial to helping research the cause, as we need to find a better cure.  A safer cure.  A cure that works 100% of the time.
