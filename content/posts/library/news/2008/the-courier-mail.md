**I WAS shocked at the amount of wrinkle-relaxing poison in the face of Jorja Fox when I watched CSI last week. There wasn't any. She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.**

She was back for Warrick's funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues' face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn't look remotely upset, even though she said she was. It was like watching a surfboard trying to cry.

I don't know how much more we're going to see of Jorja and her character Sara and I don't care, I can't see myself watching CSI again now until the new Grissom Laurence Fishburne starts. Although Sara did deliver one of the more convincing, authentic-sounding lines I think I've ever heard on CSI.

It was when she and that other cop went to Warrick's house to get him an outfit to wear in his coffin and his bed wasn't made and she said how she'd been to so many murder scenes, she would never leave her house in the morning until she'd made her bed and taken the rubbish out, in case she never came home.

I could actually imagine homicide police or whatever saying something like that, if not physically doing it. Female cops especially.

It was certainly more realistic than George Eads's theory about the wet towel . . . it was towards the end, and they're gearing up for the big chase after the dodgy cop-killing cop, and George - Nick in the show - swans in to the empty hotel room and spying a towel screwed up on the bed, picks it up, finds it's still damp, and announces they've just missed him. He's obviously never arrived home at the end of the day to find a mass of towel somewhere strange, still wet 10 hours after it's been used.

Sara would never have said that line. Maybe that's why she's no longer on the show. Although from those ads last week she must be in at least one more episode - it looked like she and Grissom were doing some naked post-something cuddling from where I was sitting.
