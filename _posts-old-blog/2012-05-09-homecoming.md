**Tidbits**

From TV Guide:
<blockquote>Guest stars abound! The episode features the debut of Peri Gilpin as D.B. Russell's wife as well as the return of Jaclyn Smith as Hodges' mother. But it's Connor O'Farrell who will make the most waves when former Undersheriff McKeen returns for the first time since he killed Warrick. He'll wage war on the CSI team, which is stuck with a sensitive case that causes Russell and Finlay to butt heads. "We have a murder that is reminiscent of the case that got Finlay fired in Seattle," executive producer Don McGill says. "It dredges up deep feelings from the past between Finlay and Russell. Finlay is someone who has a tendency to, in her quest for justice, cross the line." Although McKeen will attempt to discredit Russell, he also has his eyes on Nick, who will "really, really contemplate whether or not he wants to be a CSI anymore," McGill says.</blockquote>



Recap and screencaps will be up late tonight/early tomorrow. And that rumor that I'm getting married tomorrow is true. It's a civil ceremony, though, since for some reason the US doesn't acknowledge gay marriage nationwide. When they do, I'll have the big to-do.

By the way, it's May. Jorja's birthday is July. You know what that means!
