Oh snap! **"CSI"** better watch out. It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale *(warning, don't read this if you haven't seen the "CSI" season-ender yet)*:

I got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: "The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a 'Bizarro World CSI,' as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death. We are supposed to believe that Grissom, who has spent the past six seasons avoiding Sara or sharing terse, tension-filled moments with her, has been lying all along and that they are longtime lovers. Huh?

"Suspending disbelief is one thing and 'CSI' does stretch credulity often, but this episode was simply a travesty. Poorly written and conceived, it has disappointed and even enraged many loyal fans. Paul Guilfoyle's ace performance was pushed aside for the Grissom and Sara Show, a pairing that makes no sense on any level.

"I have never missed a new episode of 'CSI' but I wish I had missed this one and I doubt that I will be able to bear watching it in the future."
