The flowers have been purchased and should arrive on Wedensay, says sidlechick87!

<blockquote>[...] the order was bought and sent out TODAY, will arrive Wednesday. It isn't the exact same one we had chosen. I stuck with the yellow roses and decided on a YELLOW rose plant like we all wanted. It's being coupled with sage pot and a stuffed lamb :]

A small thank you note is accompanying it from JAA as well as JFO!
