<ul>
	<li>Carol sees Jorja's return as a season high point.</li>
	<li>Carol wanted Grissom to visit.</li>
	<li>Next season will have more 'intimate' looks at the character's lives.</li>
</ul>

Oh and the spoilers?

<blockquote>We know that something is for certain: at least one CSI will end up in a body bag by the episode’s end.</blockquote>

Ouch.
