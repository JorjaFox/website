## Summary

Mark returns to work, scarred both physically and emotionally. Carla goes in labor again, four weeks prematurely, and delivers a baby boy. Doug thwarts Carol's efforts to quietly celebrate her birthday. Carter begins to doubt that his future lies in surgery.

## Review

Doyle tries to help Mark feel better by bringing him a small arsenal of weapons from her family stash, including handguns, tasers and pepper spray. Carter sprays his own face with the spray.

## Notes

* Doyle keeps a gun under the seat of her car (even though this is illegal in Chicago).
