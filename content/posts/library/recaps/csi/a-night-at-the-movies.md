## Synopsis

Grissom and Catherine are called to an art house movie theater, where a dentist was killed during a showing of the Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers on a Train. Under the victim's seat, Grissom finds a cell phone, with all the recent calls from a private number, and Catherine a bloody Phillips head screw driver. One of the theater's staff says he saw a tall, blond woman leave the cinema during the movie, and she never returned.

Meanwhile, Warrick, Sara and Nick's case centers around a dead fifteen-year-old who was found in a warehouse with mysterious round bruises on his body and a single gunshot through his chest. DNA evidence on a beer bottle discovered at the scene places his older brother, Kevin, at the warehouse, but he denies all knowledge of what happened.

## Review

Not much for Sara in this episode. At the warehouse, Sara takes the outside perimeter, photographing tire treads and shoe prints -- she also finds a long bamboo pole on the roof. She tests the pole for prints and then gsr, finding nothing -- stubbornly refusing to quit, she drags it to Trace (where she trades quips with David Hodges), almost hitting people in the hall. Later she programs the bullet trajectories into the computer, discovering that their origin point is the bamboo pole.

## Notes

* Stubborn Sara appears again. Her sarcastic sense of humor also resurfaces.

**Hodges:** Give me more time -- I'm not a miracle worker.
**Sara:** Well, that's obvious, Hodges. If you were a miracle worker, you wouldn't be rude.
**Hodges:** I wasn't being 'rude', I was being 'curt'. 'Rude' would be, ...When I know, you'll know._ _(pause)_ Friends?
**Sara:** _(shakes her head, smiling tightly)_ No.
