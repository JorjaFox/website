What a year it's been.

November 1, 2007, I shut them down.  November 2, 2008, I bring 'em back.  It would have been the first, but a friend of my has a birthday this weekend, ya see.

A word of caution.  These forums are decidedly low-rent.  They're slim, trim, and low on features.  There's no way to PM users and avatars will need to be set by <a href="http://en.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> per email address (but that's on you).  They're integrated with the blog, which means nothing right now except that you'll need to log in to the blog to comment, and I'll know if you're being a twink on one or the other locations.

The one thing you won't see are a lot of rules.  I've set up some basic 'read me' topics in the forums with guidelines of how you're expected to behave. Please, be good people like I know you are. Don't pick fights, don't be an ass, and listen to your conscience.
