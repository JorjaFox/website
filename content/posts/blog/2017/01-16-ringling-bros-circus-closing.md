As we know, Jorja has adamantly opposed the treatment of animals (especially elephants) in circuses.

Well here's some amazing news. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/14/entertainment/ringling-circus-closing/index.html">Ringling Bros. will close in May 2017</a>.
<blockquote>"I have made the difficult business decision that Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey® will hold its final performances in May of this year," CEO Kenneth Feld said.

High operating costs and the decline of ticket sales "made the circus an unsustainable business for the company," Feld said.

While the circus stopped using elephants a while ago and run an elephant conservation center in Florida that focuses on the care and study of the endangered Asian elephants, Ringling Bros. has been under constant scrutiny for their treatment of animals.
