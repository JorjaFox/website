## Synopsis

The ghost of Mickey Dunn, a famous Vegas mob boss from the 70s, seemingly returns to life and kills off the four men who saw him leave the casino the night he vanished. Using a variety of disguises, he's able to keep the CSIs at bay long enough to complete his vendetta. The body found in Dunn's car was the cop who went missing, chasing Dunn. A bullet was lodged in Dunn's heart, causing a heart attack while he was being interrogated by the cops. Apparently the four Vegas punks who Dunn killed had shot and robbed him, leaving him for dead. But Dunn had survived, shot the cop and escaped.

Assuming that the bullet would kill him if removed, Mickey staged his revenge planning on dying soon after. The CSIs have the bullet removed safely, however, and Mickey is forced to serve life for five homicides.

## Review

Sara works the murder of Mason, who is strangled by Dunn, in the guise of Pamela Vorhees.
