Is that why Momma Grissom doesn't like her?'  Now we have some answers.

Grissom's mother is **Betty Grissom** (Phyllis Frelich, natch), and his ex-girlfriend is **Julia Holden** (Marlee Matlin), and Sara is still 'struggling' to learn sign language.

From Kate O'Hare at <a href="http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/12/marlee-matlin-lobbies-for-csi-chicago.html">Zap2It News</a>:

<blockquote>If Marlee Matlin has her way, there will be more "CSI" dramas than just the three -- the original, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," and its spin-offs, ("CSI: Miami" and "CSI: NY") that CBS has on the air now.

Matlin guest-stars in an episode of the original "CSI," tentatively scheduled to air Thursday, Feb. 3. In "The Two Mrs. Grissoms," which has been in production this past week, Matlin plays Julia Holden, a professor at a college for the deaf, whose mentor is fellow professor Betty Grissom (Phyllis Frelich), mother of former head CSI Gil Grissom (William Petersen).

This causes tension with Grissom's current wife, CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who simultaneously must deal with her mother-in-law and with Julia, who's also Grissom's ex-girlfriend. It doesn't help that both Julia and Mrs. Grissom are deaf and can speak to each other in American Sign Language, which Sara is struggling to learn.

As to whether Mrs. Grissom might have preferred Julia to Sara as a daughter-in-law, Matlin speaks in sign language through an interpreter, telling Zap2it, "She adores me better, I know that. I just had to say that."</blockquote>
