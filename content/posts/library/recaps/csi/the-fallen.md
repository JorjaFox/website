## Synopsis

Jacob Baker, one of the kids who pointed lasers at airplanes in "Keep Calm and Carry-On" has been arrested for totaling a politician's BMW. While D.B. Russell is collecting him, a teenager walks into the police department and starts shooting people. He ends up in an interrogation room with the shooter and an injured Baker.

The station is on lockdown, but Russell is allowed to call Jim Brass so the shooter can make demands. At first, all he wants is a laptop and medical supplies, but Russell is able to get his fingerprint to the CSIs, who ID the shooter as Mark Powell. Powell had teamed with another kid in another location to shoot up police stations together, but his cohort (who turns out to be a cop) never gives.

Russell is able to talk Powell down, but the cop he'd been planning the shooting with kills him as he surrenders. The CSIs are able to trace the emails to the computer used by Officer Dolan, but he didn't send them. Lt. Debra Hughes, who's husband (also an officer) was shot first. She'd had an affair with Dolan, and was a mentor to Powell, so she used him to clean up her messy life.

## Review
Sara goes to the hospital to get evidence and information from the wounded. She spends most of the episode at the hospital, checking with the officers wounded, but also with Lt. Hughes. When the evidence points to Hughes as the mastermind, Sara's there to accuse and arrest her.

## Notes

* Sara commiserates with Lt. Debra Hughes about having both a husband and wife with the same job.
* When Sara finds that Lt. Hughes 'conned' her and planned the whole thing, she snaps at her with righteous indignation.
