<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5610" title="Pick and Roll" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/11/vlcsnap-00060-248x140.jpg" alt="Pick and Roll" width="248" height="140" />While they delved into the personal life of DB and his family, it didn't feel overly family to me. Then again, as you can tell by the truncated recap, I didn't get all that into the episode. There was a decent amount of Sara, only three (four?) scenes, but they were long enough to entertain me.

I may go back and re-recap this (or if someone else wants to write up bits, please do).

I give it three stars for Sara for the screen time and the sassy interactions with Hodges. Also yes, that was the dad from _Family Ties_.
