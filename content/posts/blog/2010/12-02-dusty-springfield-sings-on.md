I'll let Kirsten Holly Smith tell it to you.  If you're in New York in 11 days, go send a message to her via KickStarter and she'll getcha in!

<blockquote>Dear Friends,

As you can see, the FOREVER DUSTY Kickstarter project is now complete and our funding goal has been met! Thank you so, so much for your kind and generous support!!! You don't know how much this means to all of us!

Of course, one thing it means is that our backers audition will go ahead as planned. It is scheduled for Dec. 13 at the Gene Frankel Theatre, 24 Bond St., New York, NY 10012 at 6 pm.

Unfortunately, by law (believe it or not) we are not permitted to open the show to the public, but of course you as our "backers" are invited. All we ask is that you let us know a few days in advance if you plan to attend.

We are excited to send out your rewards! Please let us get the actual backers audition done first, then we will get your rewards out as promptly as we can after that. Probably within the following couple of weeks. If you absolutely need your reward earlier (if you were planning it as a gift) please let us know. You can always message us through Kickstarter.

Thank you once again for your amazing support! We cannot do this show without you!

See you Off Broadway!!!

With love,

The Forever Dusty Team</blockquote>
