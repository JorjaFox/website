<blockquote><b>Question: Have we really seen the last of Sara Sidle on <em>CSI</em>? Last week's ending of Episode 2 was heartbreaking. The creators have invested years hinting at, building up and finally revealing the relationship between Gil and Sara. I appreciate that it hasn't been all hearts and flowers, but now that Petersen is leaving the show anyway, why not let these two tortured characters have a happy ending together? â€” Patrice</b>

<b>Matt Roush:</b> There's still a way to go before Grissom takes his final bow, and it's not in my nature to spoil any details of his final chapters even if I could. But an editor here who oversees ''CSI'' was told before the season began that Jorja Fox was set to appear in three episodes, so given that she walked away (rather powerfully, I thought) at the end of the second, there's a probability she'll be back at least once more before Gil's story is fully told. Whatever happens, I can't imagine his and her fate will be left rather open-ended.</blockquote>
