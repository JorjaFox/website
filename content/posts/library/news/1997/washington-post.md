With all the publicity when "Ellen" stepped out of the closet on ABC last spring, apparently no one noticed that the Maggie Doyle doctor character also came out on "ER" -- "There was absolutely no response to that story line," [John] Wells [Executive Producer] said "... She'll be back in the fall, he said. "She is a doctor and a character who we like, who just happens to be gay .... It doesn't make her unusual in any way within the hospital environment"
