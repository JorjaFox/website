In case you didn't know, Fanista is a social shopping website. They co-wrote, funded, co-produced and are now hosting all these videos.  And if that wasn't enough? For any fan who signs up with "Burma" as their reference code, Fanista will donate <b>10%</b> of your purchases to the  U.S. Campaign for Burma.  That's basically all their profit from e-commerce (which Mugglenet at their six figures aside, most of us make peanuts - JFO 'nets' enough to pay for costs).  Think about it.  If you bought the CSI DVDs for $50, that's $5 that goes right to helping people.

You get a DVD, they get food, protection and help.  I say it's a win-win situation.

If you want to be more direct and not get any kickbacks (good for you!), hit up our sister site, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/365519.html">JAA</a>, who will donate 100% of their donations to the cause.

(We're still collecting for Animal Acres).
