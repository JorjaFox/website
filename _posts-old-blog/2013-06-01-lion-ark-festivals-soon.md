Lion Ark will be screened at film festivals and special events during the second half of 2013. The movie was finished in April, and could be on the circuit as soon as June.

You can watch the trailer below, but I need to remind you that this will make you cry at how inhumanely people treat these animals. It just hurts to watch.
