## Synopsis

Marsha and Phil Koppelman live upstairs from an older couple who don't show up for a planned dinner. When Phil goes to check on them, he finds Bernice collapsed and Myron missing. Carlos goes looking for Myron, while Johnny looks for the full identity of a man named Dave, last seen leaping off a bridge. Connie has to sort through a high number of missing reports, most of them probably caused by a massive accident on the subway that has tied up trains for hours.

## Review

Connie is helping plan a surprise birthday party at Ray's house with Ray's wife, Barbara. She also mans the desks due to the high number of missing people following the subway accident. While many people are injured, a high number are also trapped underground and delayed. Connie gets the other detectives to help distract Ray while she goes to help Barbara with the party.

## Notes

* Connie is friendly with Ray's wife, Barbara.
