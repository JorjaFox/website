CBS is starting to release promo images from the last two episodes of the season (which will air <em>February 15th</em>). Only one has Jorja:

It looks like Ted Danson's found George's beard in some of the other photos.

<blockquote>The CSI unit faces the final showdown with the Gig Harbor killer whose motives are finally revealed. Also, Nick Stokes makes a decision that will affect the entire team moving forward, on the 15th season finale of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Sunday, Feb. 15 (10:00-11:00 PM ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. </blockquote>

Maybe Nick's the real Gig Harbor Killer and he kills off someone in the last 5 minutes!
