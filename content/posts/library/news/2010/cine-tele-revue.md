And to boost the plots, comes back an old member : Sara Sidle, gone from the show since the beginning of the season 8. Officially, Jorja Fox left *CSI* in 2007 to do others projects. Unofficially, the 41 year old actress, tired of playing second fiddle, left after the production refused to increase her salary. Obviously, they came back with better propositions

Called to the rescue for a few episodes during season 9, Sara Sidle's character becomes a regular during season 10.

Now married to Gil Grissom, the young woman gives an hand to her old colleagues from the scientific police. "Sara is not a housewife [stay at home woman]", explains the actress. "She never hide her desire for independence. Grissom and her are a modern couple and have a very healthy relationship." The audience should besides learn more about them. "Everybody wants to know what's happening between those two", entertain Jorja Fox. "This season has quite a few nice surprises..." Only certainty : no little Grissoms are in the future. She remembers: "When we decided to leave the show, I told William (Petersen) that I wanted to leave first, because I didn't want to play without him."

But since September on CBS, she is with Marg Helgenberger the new 'two-star' team of *CSI*. "Her comeback was very good for us", confess George Eads, alias Nick Stokes. "It was like being a family again. When we lost Jorja, we kind of lost the guitarist of the band. We played wrong all last season. We needed to come back to the basic, to the joy of the first days. This season 10 , more inspired, is one of the best."
