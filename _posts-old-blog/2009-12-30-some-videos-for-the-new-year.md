It's pretty quiet right now, so I thought you might like some videos to watch to get through the last couple work days before the New Years extravaganza!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/er-3x14-whose-appy-now"><img src="https://jorjafox.net/videos/files/2009/12/0314-whoseappynow.jpg" class="alignleft thumbnail" /></a> **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/er-3x14-whose-appy-now">Whose Appy Now?</a>**
From _ER_, circa 1997, episode 3x14 was when we all learned Maggie Doyle was gay.  In a very memorable scene, she takes John Carter out shooting only to run into her ex.  A stacked blond in a tight red sweater.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/er-3x20-random-acts"><img src="https://jorjafox.net/videos/files/2009/12/0320-randomacts.jpg" class="alignleft thumbnail" /></a> **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/er-3x20-random-acts">Random Acts</a>**
Again from _ER_, circa 1997, episode 3x20 was the one where Mark Greene got the crap kicked out of him by an unknown assailant.  In the beginning of the episode, Doyle's working with the crazy evangelist and quips "No meat, no men? I'm your woman!"<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/happy-hell-night"><img src="https://jorjafox.net/videos/files/2009/12/happyhellnight-001.jpg" class="alignleft thumbnail" /></a> **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos/post/happy-hell-night">Happy Hell Night</a>**
Ahhh, _Happy Hell Night_.  A truly horrific (by which I mean just plain bad) Halloween movie.  Jorja plays an unnamed sorority girl who 'seduces' one of the main characters, only to foil his plans by zipping out before sex and getting off by the crazy killer.  Whoops. Who, exactly, gets screwed, again?
