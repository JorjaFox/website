**We Know Jorja Fox's conract is under negotiation, but is her character, Sara, going to survive being abducted by the "miniature killer" in CSIs season finale?**

Executive Producer Naren Shankar says: I'm going to be asked that all summer! My response: Tune in to the season opener. We know where we're going with it. It's where we've talked about going from the beginning of this season. We'd ended last year with the reveal of Sara and Grissom's relationship and had been doing that dance of who in the lab is going to know. But, then you ask, how many coy ways can you not reveal it? We felt we had to reveal it [in the finale], so what better way to do it than in the moment of real crisis for Grissom (William Peterson)? We also wanted to leave her alone in the desert in that terrible position because we were going for something different. Most of the other victims of the killer were found in residential spaces, so we wanted a location that would make it difficult for our team to find. We ended up in the wide-open desert. And there's a strong likelihood we'll be seeing the killer again next season.
