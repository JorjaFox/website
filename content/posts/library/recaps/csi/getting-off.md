## Synopsis

Catherine and Sara deal with the death of what at first seems to be a transvestite. Later during autopsy they find out that the make-up he seemed to be wearing was actually facepaint, he was a clown. Grissom, Nick, and Warrick deal with the death of a man in a homeless area. They found out he worked in a recovery center for drug users.

## Review

During the autopsy it's discovered that what they thought was makeup is actually face paint: the victim is a clown. A nasty voicemail on the clown's answering machine leads the pair to a rival mime, and from there to the party where the clown performed last. They discover evidence -- including the clown's costume -- which shows that the wife had a sexual fixation on clowns, and that her husband murdered the clown when he caught them together.

## Notes

* Sara appears unfazed by the setting of 'Trannytown', or by what goes on there, showing a lack of prejudice concerning 'alternative' sexualities and sexual practices.

## Quotes

**Sara:** All we got is a decapitated doll.
**Catherine:** That's still legal in Nevada.

**Sara:** Samples from your suspect. There's nothing but a few track marks. No defensive wounds, no bruising. Junkies usually bruise if you breathe on them too hard. She is a pile of twigs, very frail.
**Grissom:** _looks at Sara_
**Sara:** What?
**Grissom:** I haven't seen you for a while, have I?
**Sara:** You see me every day.

**Sara:** Mr. Maguire, I hate to tell you this, but while you were off driving the other kiddies home, your wife was doing the clown.
