## Synopsis

The morning after a fantastic football game, the much loved coach of WLVU's football team wakes up bloody and beaten. Coach Miller somehow managed to half stagger through his morning routine and walk out of his on campus house, only to collapse dead on the doorstep in front of campus security. Spatter and cast off indicates that he was beaten nearly to death in his bed by a blunt and sharp object. While everyone appeared to love the coach, many of them had reasons to kill him or want him out of their life. Running back Calvin Crook is a suspect based on shoe prints, and a desire to enter the NFL draft and skip his senior year. The coach talked him into staying with a platitude and an email link to the death of Andrew Jimenez.

The secondary case is of a car found in Lake Mead. Paige Hammer, a 19 year-old from North Dakota, has been underwater for three months, having died after being trapped in a BMW. In her attempt to escape, she shot a Smith & Wesson 38, accidentally killing Andrew Jimenez, a would be rescuer. Calvin had been making out with her in the car after a party hosted by booster, and BMW dealer, Pal Arnold, but left her when Coach Miller showed up and sent the team home. Pal admits to crashing the car in the lake (while getting a blow job from Paige) and abandoning her. After Andrew was shot, he panicked and ran, but Coach Miller caught him coming back and helped cover it up to keep the team out of it. When the car was spotted over the weekend, the coach had a crisis of conscience and was going to confess everything.

However it was Calvin who killed the coach, upset at having let Coach Miller talk him into staying another year (which he only did because the coach could blackmail him for drinking, doing drugs and whoring around the night Paige died). After the Coach stopped playing Calvin, he got upset and finally snapped.
