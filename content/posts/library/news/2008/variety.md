**Jorja Fox**, co-producer of "Stay Together: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield," which opens on Feb. 7

**Book I'm reading:**

"Blink" by Malcolm Gladwell. I'm reading it in a flash.

**Total number of books I own:**

I don't really like to collect stuff. I try to pass them on. That line also hides the evidence that I don't really read that much...

**Last film I saw:**

"Mad Money." It was great!

**Who do you think was the brightest star of the silver screen?**

I don't know if she really fits the bill of 'silver screen', but I've always really admired Lucille Ball. Comedy is such a gift. And she starred in her own show and ran a studio at the same time.

**If you could play any real-life person in a movie, who would it be and why?**

I'd love to play any real person in a movie. Almost every character I've ever played has been fictional which does have its upside, of course. I think it's easier to invent someone than to manifest someone.

**Song currently playing in my iPod:**

Dusty Springfield's 'Dusty in Memphis' The whole album. I can't get enough of it.

**Ever feel that certain song lyrics were written with you in mind? What are they?:**

Well, over the last eight years or so, two songs play in my head often:

*They say I'm crazy but I have a good time.\
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime.\
Life's been good to me so far'*

- "Life's Been Good To Me," Joe Walsh

*She said I know what it's like to be dead.\
I know what it is to be sad.\
And she's making me feel like I've never been born.*

- "She Said, She Said," the Beatles

Lately I'm humming 'The Best is Yet To Come' the Tony Bennett and Diana Krall recording.

**Concert that changed your life:**

Coachella. Every year like clockwork.

**Guilty pleasure TV shows?:**

"The Daily Show," "The Colbert Report," and "Lost"

**Guilty pleasure Web sites:**

Spindaily.com, Secretfuntime.com

**What's the biggest upside of the Internet and what is its biggest downside?**

**Upside:** Instant and spontaneous gratification.

**Downside:** instant and spontaneous gratification, especially at three in the morning when you've been on line for eight hours.

**Do you have a dream project?:**

I have two. I'm doing one right now. I'm producing a musical about the life and music of Dusty Springfield called "Stay Forever" in Los Angeles at the Renberg theater. It opens February 7th and I'm really proud of it. If you like Dusty's music, you will love this show.

The second one is a script I wrote a few years back about ARMY nurses serving in Vietnam in 1967. I'd love to act in that one. No singing required.

**What helps you get out of bed in the morning?:**

Cake. I like to eat cake for breakfast. I strongly recommend it.

**Who was your celebrity crush growing up? **

Johnny Depp. Still is. Guess I'm loyal.
