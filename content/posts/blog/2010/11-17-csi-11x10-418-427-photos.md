Uh.  Do not ask me what's up with that episode title.

<blockquote>"418/427" -- The CSIs set out to track down a pedophile suspected of murdering an FBI agent's wife and kidnapping his children.</blockquote>

No. Really. I didn't believe it either.

On some review, 418 is code for Missing Persons (heh) and 427 is for Kidnapping. So ... this kind of makes sense. But then again, why aren't the FBI looking into this? I know, don't ask those questions!

Anyway, Jorja's in it!  Thank Margamania for the pic:
