Explaining that there are many things, both personal and professional, that she wants to do -- "and I really need to do some of them before I get too old" -- Jorja Fox confirms the biz's worst-kept secret, that her days as a "CSI" are ending, partly because the hit procedural "isn't". "If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would've tried harder to stay the course," she tells "Entertainment Weekly". "But I feel like it's going to be around for a while." As such, she says, "I have to get off the ride."

With Fox's send-off slated for sometime during November sweeps, might Sara-Grissom fans receive proper closure? "I don't think you're going to get that," Fox recently told the Ausiello Report. "This might sound vain, but the story of Sara and Grissom is a little like a fable, and most great fables don't really have 100 percent resolution."
