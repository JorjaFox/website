Looking forward to this! Oh and there will be a Grissom mention by Greg, from <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/Mega-Buzz-Supernatural-Spoilers-1073036.aspx" target="_blank">Mega Buzz</a>:
<blockquote><b>Anything good coming up on CSI? — Brandon</b>

<b>ADAM:</b> Wednesday's episode, which features an Innocence Project investigator reopening an old rape case, will put Greg in the spotlight — and not in a good way. "His work is called into question," executive producer Don McGill says. "There are now allegations that Greg tampered with evidence." Fortunately, Greg will have someone in his corner, at least in spirit. "Greg explains why he did what he did, and he talks about his mentor, Gil Grissom," McGill says. "Grissom taught Greg Sanders how to be a CSI: how to walk into a crime scene, how to note every observation. And Greg says, 'I was so afraid of making a mistake; I followed everything Grissom taught me to a T.'" No one's going to argue with Grissom's skills, right?</blockquote>
Enjoy!
