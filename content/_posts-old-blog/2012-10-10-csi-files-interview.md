Shane has a great interview up with Jorja, but to whet your whistle for tonight:
<blockquote><strong>CSI Files</strong>: “Code Blue Plate Special,” is a rather significant installment for Sara. How personal of a case is this to her?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Fox</strong>: Pretty personal. I think it’s going to be a really great episode; I haven’t seen it. [Laughs.] I totally expected it to be on last Wednesday–I was like, “Where are all the shows?” I enjoyed watching the debates but didn’t realize how much they would preempt everything. Not only does Sara know the victim, but she believes she knows the suspect. It’s pretty personal, I think. It’s certainly something that Sara is incredibly passionate about. You’re going to see Sara get very angry.</blockquote>
