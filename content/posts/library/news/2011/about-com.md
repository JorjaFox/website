The merry-go-round that is Jorja Fox's status on the hit CBS series *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* has changed once again - but this time the news is good.

Fox, who has been a guest star for the last four years, is returning to the show this fall as a series regular (as reported by TV Line). The actress was briefly fired from her role as CSI investigator Sara Sidle back in 2004 for failing to report to work (along with her co-star George Eads) during a contract dispute.

Fox quit the show back in 2007 and appeared in a handful of episodes over the next couple of years until returning on a recurring basis last year. Once Laurence Fishburne announced he was leaving the show, many fans hoped Sara's on-screen husband Gil Grissom (William Petersen) would return, but TPTB decided to bring in Ted Danson to shake things up on this aging series.
