Then she hit up the cabaret circuit.  Now she's doing a compilation of the full version at smaller venues.  And you can see Kirsten Holly Smith do her Dusty next at Bob Egan's New Hope on April 16th.  Bob Egan's New Hope is a home for cabaret and live performances in eastern Pennsylvania.

The show will be on Saturday,April 16 at 8:30 PM.  Tickets are $25 and there's a $25 food or drink minimum.  Not a problem when you check out <a href="http://bobegansnewhope.com">their website</a>.  Oh yes, you can order up online!  So if you're in PA, head over to New Hope and catch a great show!

<blockquote>With this show, Kirsten Holly Smith offers an opulent, stunningly performed tribute to iconic soul singer Dusty Springfield who died of cancer in 1999 at 59 years old. In this powerhouse one woman tour-de-force, she hauntingly recreates the lady, the era and the image who influenced a generation of pop singers with her unique blend of traditional pop and blue-eyed soul vocals starting in the 1960s. No one had a voice like Dusty Springfield. Ms. Smith captures the essence of the off-beat, psychedelic style of the 1960s and 1970s as the singer rose to fame, as well as the sound that created the legend. The show is a compilation of a larger theater piece called, “Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield” which was performed on the west coast at The L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center’s Lily Tomlin/Jane Wagner Cultural Arts Center recently to rave reviews.</blockquote>
