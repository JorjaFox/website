**Romance is on the cards for Sara and Grissom after a night of passion**

There's nothing like a headless corpse and the near-death of a colleague to get you in the mood for romance. At least this week that is how it seems in this week's episode of US drama CSI.

In the final episode of the sixth series, Grissom is relaxing in his bedroom, when who should emerge from his bathroom wearing nothing except a silky robe and a warm smile but his colleague Sara Sidle!

"Sara fell in love with Grissom at the beginning," says Jorja Fox, who plays forensic cop Sara in the hugely successful series. "Over the years, we've danced around with it and now there's this shock ending."

"I don't know where it'll go, but it's fun to play something quite touching and lovely."

Before the light relief, however, the CSI team are on tenterhooks. Following last week's shooting, the life of their boss Jim Brass is hanging in the balance.

Meanwhile, Sara and Grissom have to examine a grisly corpse whose head has been severed by a train.

"I'm the most squeamish person in the group, so now it's a joke to give me some of the gorier stuff" says Jorja, 38. "We're like a dysfunctional family on set. We make fun of each other all the time."

Jorja hopes to pen an episode in season seven, which starts filming this autumn. "Part of the deal is that I have to work with a group of writers," she says. "It'll be a learning experience."

"I'm really excited about next season."
