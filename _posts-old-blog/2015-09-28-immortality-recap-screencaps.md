Well. That was the end. If you're still reading this, you better be okay with spoilers.

And speaking of, let's get this one out of the way.

<em>We got the GSR happy ending.</em>

Grissom and Sara run off to save the ocean and Catherine runs the lab with her daughter. You got that right? Catherine put her hat in the ring and Sara left.

And CSI had 12.12 million viewers last night (per <a href="http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=43569">CBS Press Express</a>):

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">With an Average of 12.12 Million Viewers,<br>“CSI” Is Sunday's Top Scripted Broadcast in ViewersThe series finale of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION delivered its largest audience since January 2012 and ranked as Sunday's top scripted broadcast in viewers, according to Nielsen preliminary live plus same day ratings for Sept. 27.From 9:00-11:00 PM, CSI averaged 12.12 million viewers, its biggest audience since Jan. 25, 2012, and scored 1.8/05 in adults 18-49 and 2.7/07 in adults 25-54, its best deliveries in those demographics since May 7, 2014.</blockquote>

My guess for Lindsey dying was wrong (it would have been a full circle with Holly Gribbs) but I'm good with that. My delight in seeing a high number of scenes where Jorja acts and has no dialog is at an all time high.

<h2>Part One</h2>

We start with a 'normal' episode of CSI. Death, old friends, more death, a surprise return, another death, a surprise not-dead, and it just keeps coming. As soon as Catherine showed up in Vegas, I muttered "Oh it's&nbsp;Catherine 'Conflict of Interest' Willows." That is the one very consistent and annoying part about Catherine. She is always tap dancing right over that line. I'm sad they blew up Brass, but he lives and I was so happy to see him. Sara and Catherine, as friends, is still a weird universe.

<h2>Part Two</h2>

This was a roller coaster. Tricky DNA, fake bodies, Heather and Catherine knowing Sara loves Grissom... That ending though. It was all overshadowed by that ending. I do want to mention that the scene where Grissom and Sara are waiting for the bees, and Sara is silent and Grissom is questing for words, is some of the best physical acting those two can do. That's why I believed in GSR in the end. Billy and Jorja are two of the best 'silent' actors on that show. Always have been. I wasn't even sad they took away Sara's last line of 'Wait! Wait.' It was unnecessary.

The last line of the show goes to Lindsey Willows 3.0: "I watched the whole interrogation. I learned a lot. Especially at the end. You should watch it."

Yes. You should watch it.

I can't really collect my thoughts and I admit to having written this last night and letting the images process on their own. What did you guys think? What was your favorite quote?
