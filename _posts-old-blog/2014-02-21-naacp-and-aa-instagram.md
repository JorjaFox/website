Saturday night (tomorrow!) is the NAACP Image Awards. Lion Ark's up for nomination, so best of luck to everyone!

Here's a photo of Jorja at the luncheon:

And here's one from the Artists &amp; Athletes upcoming PSA: What's Your Cause?

For those who wondered about my reply, my personal cause is the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF)</a>, who are dedicated to protecting our rights on the Internet. Do you like transformative works like fanart and fanfic? You should consider the EFF as one of your causes too.

Of course, my other cause is humanitarianism and part of that is treating animals like we would want to be treated too! Have you donated for the Lion Ark fundraiser yet? The odds of more places getting to see Lion Ark goes up with the more funding they get. <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jorjafox46/">Toss a couple bucks at the JFO Birthday Fundraiser for Jorja</a>. The money goes to ADI.
