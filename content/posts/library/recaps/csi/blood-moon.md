## Synopsis

A headless body is found, propped up against a barbed-wire fence with the head on a post, in a field, under the harvest (aka blood) moon. Wax left on the body from an extensive manscaping leads the CSIs to a hotel where a vampire and werewolf convention is taking place and a man named Michael Wilson is missing. Michael had come to a Clans and Covens convention with his fiance to get married with all their friends but was killed by his fiance when she learned that Michael had formerly been a werewolf, but had fallen in love with her, a vampire, and converted.

## Review

Sara works on the body after it's brought to the morgue, and determines that all body hair was waxed off, finding some wax and sugar in his belly button. She also works in the lab for much of the episode, with the evidence.

## Notes

* Sara works in the lab this episode.
* Sara and Nick tease each other.
* Sara still doesn't call Grissom 'Gil'.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Wolves don't normally attack humans. Blame the owner, not the wolf.

**Sara:** This car is a gas guzzler. You'd think a wolf would be more environmentally conscious.

**Sara:** Did you know a 12 letter world for a walk in the woods is 'Transylvania'?
**Nick:** Grissom? Is that you, Grissom?
**Sara:** Shut up.
**Nick:** Gil?
**Sara:** I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him that, either.
**Nick:** No? You really don't think so?
**Sara:** I don't.
**Nick:** After all this time.
