<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/03/powerplant-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="powerplant" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3210" /> I held off on posting for a couple reasons, least of which is that my father and his wife live in Japan, about 200km south of the Fukushima power plant.  I visited him out there in 2008.  He says things are worse than they look on TV, but he's okay.  While I don't want to dilute from the Animal Acres fundraiser, I do want to make a 'personal' plea.  Something I said I'd never do!

If you're able to, please donate to the <a href="https://american.redcross.org/site/Donation2?idb=0&5052.donation=form1&df_id=5052">American Red Cross International - Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Response</a>.

That's it.  That's all I'm asking of everyone.  The Red Cross is needed right now to help people who were injured, and if the power plant goes from worse to horrific, they will be needed to help more.  The minimum donation they accept is $10, but as a lot of you guys are students, consider donating blood or plasma instead.  That's always needed, and will be very welcome.

Be careful about scammers, by the way.  There are a lot of people out there looking to make a buck off this, and will trick you.  Only give money to accredited people you can trust.

And thank you.
