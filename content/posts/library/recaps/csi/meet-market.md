## Synopsis

A faked death turns into a case of body-part trafficking, when a Jewish body turns up with his bones replaced with pipe. Orthodox Jews don't believe in donating their body parts, and the dead body found had leukemia. The body part clinic caused the death of over thirty people, having used unhealthy body parts.

Margo Darton is found, killed in her home, beaten by a champagne bottle. She'd been seeing a 'Host' at the Over/Under Club, who acted as a pretend relationship, named Jesse. Margo had brought Jesse home to show him that she was actually his mother, and in a fit of anger, he killed her.

## Review

Sara works the Dorton case, and 'bids' on a stripper's panties with her CSI ID, while looking to find where Margo died. She places an 'order' for Jesse and discusses Margo with him.

Sara and Keppler look over the Miniature Crime Scenes. Keppler says that Grissom is a collector, and compares him to a serial killer he knew.

Meanwhile, on his sabbatical, Grissom writes Sara a letter, claiming their parting was awkward and he'll miss her.

## Notes

* Sara put the cocoon Grissom sent her into one of his terrariums.
