<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4037" title="Vegetarian Times" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/11/vegetariantimes-210x140.jpg" alt="Vegetarian Times" width="100" height="75" />Pick up the December 2011 issue of <a href="http://www.vegetariantimes.com/">Vegetarian Times</a> for a Q&amp;A with Jorja!

Can't pick it up?  I wrote up her interview on the wiki: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Vegetarian_Times_(December_2011)">[Q&amp;A] Jorja On Our Minds</a>

Part of me awards them negative points for that title (if you search the archives, you'll see how many times it's been used, folks, it's not that innovative).  On the other hand, there are two awesome tidbits about Jorja that I didn't know.

First, she's an activist because of her grandmother.  Second, in June she adopted a rescue dog!  While no one can replace her beloved Ali, it's great that she rescued another dog (this one from south Texas).

Props to my friend Jen for telling me about the article!
