## Synopsis

A teenage couple, making out in a car, are sprayed with blood from the sprinkler system. Inside the house is a quadruple homicide that has, literally, painted the Chambliss house red. Due to the water recycling system (grey water is reused to water the lawn), the blood that went down the drain came out the sprinklers. The youngest child in the house, a small girl, Fiona, was cleaned up in fresh clothes after she was killed. Finally, a young man, John Lee, stained in blood, is found holding the girl's bloody nightgown, crying that he loved her. John Lee's house is that of a man-child. He seemed to have never grown up, and for some reason, stalked the youngest girl. When pressured, John confesses to have killing the Chambliss family.

Shortly after they announce they have the killer, a woman comes to the station complaining that *she* is the killer. Leslie Gitig claims she was having an affair with the father, Calvin, and she killed them all. Traffic cameras, phone records and gas receipts all back up her story. In addition, she knows information not released to the press. When the evidence tells the CSIs that John Lee didn't kill the family, they look back at Leslie Gitig, who tells a solid story, but it seems too rehearsed. John Lee recognizes her, and her car, however, allowing for some credibility. Still, it's far more likely she used her law enforcement contacts from her job (legal secretary) to gather inside information.

The Chambliss family was also selling drugs, and prints on the money lead them to Lonny Gallows, a drug addict. However it's Lonny's boss, and father, who confesses to the crime, after blood stained boots and gloves are found in Lonny's truck. Maurice Gallows claims he tried to protect his son by killing the family who hooked Lonny back on drugs after Maurice put him through rehab.

All three confessors, however, use the same verbiage: I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family. The three, Lee, Gitig and Gallows, met up at a auto shop after Gitig hit Gallows' truck. Lee worked at the auto-shop. The three conspired to create reasonable doubt as to who actually killed the Chambliss family. It was Leslie Gitig's plan, and John Lee, upset over his part, shot Leslie Gitig and then confessed the true story and killed himself. Maurice Gallows shot Cal, while Leslie Gitig killed the rest.
