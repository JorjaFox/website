## _CSI: Vegas_ (Oct. 6, CBS)

One year after _CSI_'s 20th anniversary, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) are back. "It's _Groundhog Day_," says Fox, who teases "a crazy twist" involving Capt. Jim Brass (show vet Paul Guilfoyle). Brass' connection to a crime prompts the pair to team up with the CSI lab's new boss (Paula Newsome), new investigators (including _Kingdom_'s Matt Lauria), and old pals, such as lab tech David Hodges (Wallace Langham). It's like old times for Sara and Gil — but, adds Fox, "We do see them stay in a swanky hotel they [previously] couldn't afford!" _—Lynette Rice_
