Sadly, Prop 8 passed into law in California, and it became _illegal_ for anyone besides one man and one woman to marry.  Since then, Californians and people world wide have argued that the Proposition is unconstitutional.  Meaning it would be against the U.S. Constitution and thus invalid.

Today, U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will decide if Prop 8 is unconstitutional or if it stands.

If you're interested in learning more about this decision, Metro Weekly has a great Prop 8 Decision Day FAQ.

If you're interested in protesting Prop 8 and standing up for equality everywhere, Rox Wockner has complied a list of Prop 8 Day of Decision rallies.

I don't know if Jorja will be at any of these (the CSI heads are all filming in Vegas this week) but she stood up against this once and has always been a proponent of equality.
