You know, I only trust these so far. They said the same things last year, but we didn't get a whole lot.
<blockquote>**Who's new or returning:** McGill says they'll focus on the core cast this season -- including, finally, answering the perplexing question: What's up with Sara (Jorja Fox) and Grissom (the long-departed William Petersen)? He's been in the jungle for years, but she's still on the case -- are they even married anymore? "We'll answer that, in a way that may surprise people." McGill says. "We'll deal with her dissatisfaction with the long-distance relationship, and may find a resolution as to where the marriage is headed." The season also will explore the relationship of Ecklie to his estranged CSI daughter Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) -- and his romance with Hodges' mom Olivia (guest Jaclyn Smith).</blockquote>

So take it with a grain of salt.

FWIW: They're not breaking up Grissom and Sara. Both Billy and Jorja are too fond of the character's relationships for that to happen. And don't pin your hopes on a geek-baby, guys, we've been told <em>many</em> times that won't be happening.
