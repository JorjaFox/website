***Mandeep Dhillon, Jorja Fox, and Paula Newsome are solving crimes, changing the game, and kicking ass in CSI: Vegas.***

“I’ll give you a fact,” Jorja Fox says cheerfully. The actress has spent the past 40 minutes on a Friday afternoon talking all things *CSI*, but before she takes and enjoys her weekend, she’s eager to share a crucial piece of information courtesy of a recent conversation with Daniel Holstein, a forensic detective and the series’ tech adviser. “He told me that when he started out, maybe four percent of the crime scene investigators out there were women,” she says. “But now, the statistic is almost reversed!”

And though Fox is reluctant to take personal credit for the remarkable increase—she did, after all, play methodical-yet empathetic scientist Sara Sidle for nearly 15 years on the top-rated and groundbreaking smash *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*—she is more than proud. “It’s flattering because women are persistent and problem-solvers, and they have seen this is a job that they can do,” she says. “It’s also cool and exciting because on the new show we are reflecting reality as much as we can.”

Viewers will see the evidence in the much-anticipated *CSI: Vegas*. Set in the city where the drama all began in 2000, the sequel features Fox’s Sidle and William Petersen’s Gil Grissom—last seen in 2015 sailing into the sunset together to the strains of a Norah Jones ballad—returning to the crime lab to investigate a new threat. They’ll preserve and serve justice with the help of some new experts, including TV veteran Paula Newsome (*Chicago Med*, *Barry*) as department supervisor Maxine Roby, and London native Mandeep Dhillon (*After Life*) as Allie Rajan, a level-II CSI.

The co-stars had already filmed seven out of the 10 episodes when they each jumped on the phone and proceeded to rave about one other. “They are both really strong, brave, and interesting women,” Fox says. “I was so excited when it was announced they were joining the cast.” Seconds Dhillon, “I love that we’re three smart, bad-ass characters who get s--t done.”

We do, too.

**Share some intel about Jorja and Paula.**

**MD:** We don’t get too many scenes together, which is a shame. But when we do, it’s always fun. Jorja is so chill and lovely. Paula has great energy. It’s great to see strong and smart women on the show, especially black and brown women. It’s very important, and I’m happy the producers went in that direction.

**How did you end up back on the show?!**

**JF:** It’s like *Groundhog Day*, right? Sara had such a great ending, and I thought the book was closed for sure. Then, over a year ago, [executive producer] Jerry Bruckheimer reached out because the 20th anniversary of the show was coming up. He said, “What do you think of doing something for the anniversary?” Due to the pandemic, we didn’t get to do it last year. But better late than never.

**Did it feel strange to be back on the set?**

**JF:** It was like *Alice in Wonderland* in a very sci-fi sort of way. You know, when I first thought of doing the show, I wanted my comfort zone with the same group of actors and crew. Five years later, I’m with all these phenomenal new people. I love this group, and we have such an interesting dynamic.

**What have you been up to over the past six years?**

**JF:** Well, in 2020 I probably saw more movies and TV shows than I have since I was in seventh grade and not allowed to go out! I was grateful for it. My life has been more behind the camera, working on documentaries than in front of it, so I’ve been able to blend right back in to just being another person walking the street in L.A. I will say that, before the pandemic, I was in Fiji—I was surprised the show is still playing every night there!

**And how has Sara changed?**

**JF:** Sara Sidle is definitely my all-time favorite character. I still don’t find her boring, which is kind of a miracle. Now there’s a lightness of being with her. When you travel the world to tropical places and work against climate change and mammal extinction, you’re in a pretty amazing place even though the work is challenging. And she’s doing it with her husband, the man she loves. She comes back in a really good place.

**Just to confirm, she and Grissom are still married?**

**JF:** Yes, they’re still married! That’s something new. They’ve had this on-and-offlove afair for 20 years, but we didn’t see it on
screen that much.

**When did you first find out that Sara and Grissom were going to pair up?**

**JF:** From the opening bell. When I auditioned for the job in early 2000, I knew from the character description that Sara would be the love interest for Gil Grissom. Then the show took off kind of fast in a way none of us were prepared for, so the writers started looking at it like a long game. We didn’t want it to burn out too fast.

**What are you allowed to say about the new storylines?**

**JF:** This is an action-adventure journey, and you’re going to get shot out of a rocket right away. Every week the cases are wild. We’re giving you superheroes that solve difficult puzzles with their minds and hearts and not with weapons. And we’re going to provide justice and truth.

Back in 2000, the show provided this scientific foundation where we could prove beyond a shadow of doubt whether something was true. Our main goal was to highlight science. Now we’re going to remind the audience about truth. Truth is real. That’s the existential theme.

**Science has evolved since even the last episode. What cool new thing have you learned?**

**JF:** OK, let’s say you have 10 prints on a piece of tile. You can now separate all 10 of those prints; whereas in 2000 you’d have a bunch of prints that were sort of ruined because they all overlapped. It’s called a 3D comparator. It’s mind-boggling.

**Could you be a real CSI?**

**JF:** I’ve always been interested in science, particularly life sci
ence. So this is for sure my wheelhouse. I still feel like I’m not
the sharpest knife in the drawer at CSI, even though I do enjoy it.
When I look at everything, I don’t understand why crime hasn’t
just stopped. It’s really to get away with anything anymore.
Maybe that’s the moral of the story.

**Share some intel about Paula and Mandeep.**

**JF:** They’re both very cool. I really admire Mandeep’s adventurous spirit. Just to put it in a context, she lives in London and she’s traveled about 6,000 miles to work with people she never met in a place where she doesn’t have many friends in a worldwide pandemic! She’s also this amazing dancer who can do a phenomenal amount of numbers from Bollywood movies. And Paula is a force of nature and an incredible Broadway vocal talent. I love her spirit, her patience, and her strength. I love that I get to watch Paula and Mandeep in action. They bring an enthusiasm and a joy to the show that is contagious to everyone who gets to be around them.

**And what’s your secret talent?**

**JF:** I’m tone deaf! You know, I think I’m an amazing dancer. I really do. I’ve always thought that about myself, but I’ve never had a chance to prove it. I hope I will sooner rather than later. I can also play guitar and drums.

**Confess: What’s your craziest Vegas experience?**

**JF:** So I was staying in a big fancy hotel on the strip and got stuck in the elevator between the 60th and 40th floor for an hour! It gave me a lot of anxiety, and not just because I was going to be late for work. Here’s another one: One day we were shooting right next to a drive-up wedding chapel. I sat on a bench and watched every one come in on these trailer trucks to get married. I saw all kinds of Elvises and learned that the interpretations of Elvis in Vegas are quite broad.

**Share some intel about Jorja and Mandeep.**

**PN:** After I heard Mandeep was cast, I found her on Instagram and asked her to dinner. She loves her bread and butter and salt! I love working with her because she’s a fun millennial. I still have to ask her how to post something on social media! Jorja is kind,
smart, and considerate. I’m grateful that she’s been part of the show for so long and knows the ins and outs. It’s a huge benefit.
