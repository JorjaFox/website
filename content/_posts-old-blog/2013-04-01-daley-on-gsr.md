<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6876" alt="Daley and Fox" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/04/425990_10151242667651332_1808399906_n.jpg" width="275" height="140" /> Fresh from CSI Files comes a jolly interview with Michael F.X. Daley, who has worked on four CSI episodes now: "Lying Down with Dogs," "Man Up," "Spilt Decisions," and the upcoming "Sheltered." Daley leans to dark comedy, but says that his upcoming episode will flaunt his dramatic chops.

Daley also has a viewpoint on GSR, and why he thinks the divorce is actually a good idea:
<blockquote><strong>CSI Files</strong>: The season is winding down. What are some of your favorite moments from this season? Anything you would have liked to do, but weren’t able to?

<strong>Daley</strong>: I was happy we brought the dog on the team.  I’m a real dog lover (as is over half the staff) and Sam was great in his episode.  SPOILER: You may even see him in mine!

I personally loved what we did with Sara’s character this year.  I know I’ll lose some GSRs off my <a href="http://twitter.com/mfxdaley" target="_blank">Twitter</a> now, but <strong>Jorja Fox </strong>is an amazing actress and that was an incredible performance.  It’s time for Sara to become her own character, and not be defined by an off screen Grissom.</blockquote>

Also that picture of Daley and Fox is from the set of Sheltered, so we're right and tight that she's in this week's episode!
