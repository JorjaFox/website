CBS has been running this ad on Facebook, and while I'm not a fan of the _very_ obvious digital retouching going on (seriously, Marg and Ted look weird), the photos are clearly from the new photo shoot, and there's Jorja on the right!

That's a good sign?  Right?

I thought so too.

I put the ad in the sidebar as well, so we can all be excited and happy about the idea of new episodes in just two weeks.

That's right.  Two.  Weeks.
