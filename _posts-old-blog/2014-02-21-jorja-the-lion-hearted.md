Thanks to Lanos for finding this new interview with Jorja (and yes, I know they call her Jor**g**a all over the place).

Excerpt from <a href="http://sharpheels.com/2014/02/jorjafoxlions/">Jorja's Lionhearted Activism</a>:
<blockquote>**SH:** Being a woman do you ever feel like you have to worker harder to get your message and your work out there?

**JF:** I’m really lucky because I haven’t personally experienced this yet. But then the odds of making any money from documentaries are small.  I’ll have to let you know once or if I slide into the profit range

I do know that women/actresses still make less then men. Any great movie or television show has four to five roles for guys, and only one for women (and it’s usually not as interesting). Fortunately, it’s never held me back. As a producer I’ve worked with men and women and been respected and appreciated.

I owe a lot of it to my parents and my father was an amazing male role model. They always told me I could do whatever I wanted when I grew up as long as I worked hard. As a producer I’m just getting started. I’m excited to see what the next five years will bring.</blockquote>
Of note: Season 14 of CSI has <em>not</em> yet finished filming! They're on episode 20 out of 22.
