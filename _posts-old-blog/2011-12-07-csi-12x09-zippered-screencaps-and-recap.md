<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4097" title="zippered-recap" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/12/zippered-recap-230x153.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="153" />It's a _very_ generous three stars for Sara on this one, but mostly because she used science on this one.  Four scenes, two short, three with science goodness, one with snark.  It could be a lot worse.

</ul>
The best I can say about it is that Sara was ... Sara.  Her use of the document scanner had me shouting "<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/xkcd/dac5/">Stand back! I'm going to try science!</a>"

There's no Sara in next week's episode, which is about Doc Robbins (he delivers!) and his wife.
