## Synopsis

Ray is shocked when he is told his ex-partner is being transferred into his department. Problem is she is female and rumours were rife that they were having an affair. Meanwhile a boy goes missing from party of schoolchildren on a museum tour.

## Review

Connie works the case of a disoriented woman brought in by a cabbie with no wallet, purse or ID, claiming her name is Minerva Fitzhugh. Minerva is aware that she's lost and she can't remember anything. She's only one of a pair of little old ladies missing from a Gold Coast private residence. Apparently the girls were sisters and lived together, Minerva went off to look for her sister, Betty Carr. Due to a stroke, Minerva has trouble remembering what year it is, or even remembering who Connie or her doctor are. Betty has been caring for Minerva since the stroke.

While Connie's at home, the morgue calls to tell her they found a woman matching Betty's description, beaten to death. The housekeeper is able to ID the body as Betty, but the doctor doesn't know how to handle Minerva. Suffering from both retrograde and anterograde amnesia, Minerva can't remember anything after 1970, and can only hold onto new memories for a short while. Salvation is found when Joanne McDonald, the daughter of the oldest sister, arrives. Minerva mistakes Joanne for her sister, and Joanne offers to take Minerva home.

## Notes

* Connie lives alone and sleeps in a twin bed.
