George Eads and Jorja Fox have been sacked from *C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation* for breach of contract.

The pair were sacked after they failed to show up for work on Thursday (15th), the first day of production on the crime drama's fifth season.

According to reports, the no-show was a deliberate tactic as part of an ongoing pay dispute with CBS.

The duo were seeking raises from their previous salary, estimated at $100,000 an episode.

Casting has already begun for new characters to replace Eads' and Fox's roles on the show.
