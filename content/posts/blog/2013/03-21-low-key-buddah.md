Amusingly, this is from the OC Register, which is my local paper.

Azar "Aze" Salehi says her store, Bella Bazaar, is known for having the best Buddhas around â€“ little carved wooden Buddhas, midsize ceramic Buddhas, a long golden reclining Buddha, a fat one, a smiling one and a sitting one chipped from a piece of stone so heavy that Salehi can hardly lift it.

[...]

Her most well-known shopper is actress Jorja Fox from "CSI." "She comes in and I never recognize her," Salehi said. "She's really low-key and relaxed."
