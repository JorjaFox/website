While cast and crew remain tight-lipped on the details, we can reveal that the violent outcome has a major bearing on another of the show's most intriguing storylines - the clandestine relationship between Grissom and his fiesty colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox).

As the CSI team tries to track down the killer, Sara goes missing and her secret relationship with Grissom is forced into the open.

Whether Sara becomes another victim of the mini-replica killer remains to be seen, especially in the light of speculation over Jorja Fox's future on the show. After seven years playing Sara, the actress is still in negotiations with producers over her contract following a pay dispute that reportedly saw her walking out during the filming of the finale.

So will this be the last we see of the sparky investigator? "Everybody's going to have to tune into the next series to see what happens to her, as she's left in a bit of a bind," reveals Fox, who was dismissed over another salary dispute in 2004 before being rehired. "All I can say is they don't call it a cliffhanger for nothing!"
