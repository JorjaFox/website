It hasn't gone unnoticed that Jorja's sites (<a href="http://jorjafox.com">http://jorjafox.com</a> and <a href="http://jorjafox.org">http://jorjafox.org</a>) look a little different.  At first people worried her sites were hijacked, but a little internet detective-ing has been called for.

First, both sites look the same right now. So that means for someone to have ‘jacked them, they had to get both.  The odds of that happening are pretty slim for any two websites, and they get slimmer when the sites are on different servers.  Her .org site lives on a server owned by <a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/jorjafox.org">Affinity Network</a> and .com is on hosted on <a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/jorjafox.com">Rackspace</a>.  Two totally different companies being hacked with the same website design is unlikley.

There is a possibility that both domain names expired and were bought by someone else.  Thankfully you can go to whois you can see who ‘owns’ each site.  Both .com and .org are protected by whoisprivacyprotect and jorjafox.com hasn’t moved since 2008, and .org was last updated on 14-Feb-2011, which is <em>before</em> the html change (which per wayback machine happened after July of this year).

Add it all up? Jorja’s giving her sites a facelift and I am delighted.  I'm super excited since they show that they're using WordPress (my favorite CMS/blog software).  Does this mean she'll have a blog?  Impossible to say.  A lot of people use WordPress because it's easy to run a website, not for any blogging needs.

As for the date on the picture?  It looks like Sunday January 15th is the go-live date (late Saturday the 14th maybe) depending on the timezone.  I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to it!
