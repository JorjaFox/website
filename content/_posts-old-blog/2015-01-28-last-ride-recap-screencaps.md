It was a nice return to Sassy Sara. Bumping the car to activate the alarm and pushing back on the brothers, while still being sensitive to the parents of the dead girl.

This gets four stars just based on the sheer amount of Sara. And for being a good episode.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/The_Last_Ride">Recap</a> (4 of 5 stars)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season15/16-lastride/">Screencaps</a> (216 images)</li>
</ul>
And now we have a break until February 15th. Which is good. I need a nap!

Edit: If you missed it, the ratings were up 24% and 33% from the last two eps of CSI. <a href="http://tvline.com/2015/01/28/csi-season-15-ratings-high/">TV Line</a>'s report is up. The evidence is in. CSI does just awesome on a week night.
