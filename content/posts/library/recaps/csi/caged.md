## Synopsis

Grissom and Nick investigate the death of a book restorer while Catherine and Sara are called to the scene of a fatal train crash.

When the female book restorer is found dead and locked inside a 'cage' a temperature-controlled workspace, Grissom and Nick attempt to determine whether this is a case of suicide or homicide. They discover that the key to solving the case may be a co-worker who suffers from autism.

Meanwhile, Catherine and Sara are sent to comb through the wreckage of a collision between a train and an SUV and find out if it is a case of road rage or simply an accident.

## Review

At the scene, when Sara finds the dog running loose, she's concerned about getting it back to its owner. Later she and Catherine track down the victim's last stop from the dog biscuits found in the wreck, and then examine the suspect's car to determine if it was at the scene.

## Notes

* Not unexpectedly, Sara empathizes with the female victim.
* Sara understands the bond between people and their pets.
