The original cast members reflect on the highs and lows of starring in the CBS drama

**Jorja Fox** (Sara Sidle): “I think Sara is the least-liked character on the show. As much as she has a lot of fans, I think she has more who dislike her. Obviously Sara had her sights on Grissom. He’s our protagonist and all eyes see the lab through Grissom, especially through the first nine seasons. So all of sudden there is Sara in that vision. But there were fans who wanted Gil to hook up with Catherine or Lady Heather [Melinda Clarke]. I also think Sara is socially awkward and stands by her guns no matter what. That can be grating to people. She never cared that much about being popular. She cared about getting to the truth of things. Maybe for my own survival, I tried to see it as a compliment. Whether fans loved your or hated you, at least they were emotionally invested or feeling passionate about Sara.”
