<blockquote>I would be remiss if I didn't tell you I'm profoundly heartbroken. But oddly I'm also feeling slightly liberated. I just want to thank you, all our fans, for taking this crazy, strange, journey with us all these years. And for allowing me to take flight on the magic carpet ride of a lifetime. Stay tuned, because I think we have one more for the road. But in the meantime, lets face the music and dance.</blockquote>

Jorja, we've had a blast on the CSI magic carpet ride. I know whatever happens next, it'll be worthwhile because you're both an awesome actress and an immensely caring individual.

Let's all dance and enjoy one more for the road. I'm not quite ready to say goodbye yet.
