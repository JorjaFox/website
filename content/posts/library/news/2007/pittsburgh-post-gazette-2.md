Maybe I'm too well-adjusted to relate (and that would be a first), but **Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) departs CBS's "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"** (9 tonight) in the most unrealistic, only-on-TV way possible.

To really get into a critique of her departure would entail giving away things that CBS has asked critics not to reveal, but from my perspective, it's not how real people say goodbye to those they love.

The episode finds Sara confronting a case from her past when a crime in the present sends a coed plunging out a dorm room window. This crime, the characters involved and Sara's recent stint trapped under a car in the desert all play into Sara's good-bye.

As for where Sara's headed, well, I think she may be hanging on a tropical island with Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) from "Criminal Minds" given some parallels in their swan songs.
