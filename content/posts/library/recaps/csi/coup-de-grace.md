## Synopsis

An undercover cop is killed by a possibly racist police officer under suspicious circumstances. The witnesses, who are primarily black, claim the white officer who shot the black cop did so when the deceased was already down, contradicting what the officer says. The evidence backs up the witnesses, and the rookie officer didn't see what happened. A second case at a school appears to be a gang execution of a snitch, but the cases intersect when the two victims turn out to have been talking regularly. The killing is proven to be coincidental, but the accused killer committed suicide before the CSI's can clear him.

## Review

Sara returns from visiting Grissom in Paris for a week. She joins Ecklie at the morgue to help identify the body and work with the autopsy, before heading to crime scene to work with Greg. At the autopsy, she recognizes that based on the color of the body fat, the dead police officer was a vegetarian, which makes his ordering burgers from a fast food meat restaurant very strange.

When the second case comes in, Sara picks it up. When Nick calls the phone of a contact to his case, Sara's victim's phone rings and she answers, connecting the cases. Working with the detectives, and some fancy new software, Sara narrows down her vic's possible killers to a gang known as the D-Street Killers, where they find the killer, and he's also a witness to the cop killing.

## Notes

* Catherine obliquely references the many times she and Sara have said things to and near each other in the heat of the moment, which Sara acknowledges silently.
