**Laurence Fishburne** (Dr Ray Langston) will not be returning for season twelve of *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*, but the rest of the show’s cast is readying to return. Details on who is returning and how after the jump!

As CSI Files previously reported, Fishburne will not be returning for the upcoming twelfth season. However, despite breathless Internet rumors, no one else will be absent when the show resumes September 21st.

“**George** [**Eads**, Nick Stokes] and **Eric** [**Szmanda**, Greg Sanders] are returning. **Jorja** [**Fox**, Sara Sidle] is returning. **Paul** [**Guilfoyle**, Jim Brass] is returning,” a source close to the show confirms to CSI Files. “Although, I think… Paul may also have a situation where he’s not in every episode, he wants some time off occassionally. Jorja and Paul are in the same situation as last season.”

**Wallace Langham** (David Hodges), is also set to return. ”He may not be in a couple episodes because he may be doing a movie,” the source elaborates.

Additionally, **Elisabeth Harnois **(Morgan Brody), who was first introduced in season eleven’s “Cello and Goodbye,” will “return and be reintroduced,” the source says. Her first appearance will be in this fall’s premiere, which will also include the appearance of **Marc Vann** (Conrad Ecklie), who plays her estranged father

Season twelve will, however, see the departure of **Marg Helgenberger **(Catherine Willows). “Marg will be with us for most of the season, [but it's looking] like she’ll be leaving in February,” the source reveals. “There’s flexibility to how we air episodes this season.”
