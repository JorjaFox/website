## Synopsis

Three separate cases are all committed by the same revenge-seeking retired police officer, Stan Richardson. Dying of cancer, Richardson arranged for his friend, Detective Sam Vega, to perform the killing for him. When caught in the act, Vega choses to suicide by cop and is shot and killed.

Kevin Fetzer, a well-off entrepreneur who created Joystick Jungle, an arcade for adults, is beaten to death with an arcade ball (aka skeeball), which Kevin himself once used in a fight with a younger boy, Mikey Moran, killing him. In another case, Ramon Castillo is found burnt to a crisp inside tires in gang territory. His arch enemy, Diego Barra, claims he had nothing to do with it, but suggests Marta Arterro, Barra's ex-girlfriend came back from the dead to do it, as she was murdered by Castillo in a similar fashion. In the third case, Darlene Crocker, kills herself while hopped up on PCP, which was used to kill Crocker's daughter years ago.

## Review
