I've decided the only annoying thing about <em>Missing Persons</em> is the episode titles.  The rest of it's just stock standard TV for the day!  Anyway, <a href="http://allaboutmarg.com/wordp/">All About Marg</a>'s donation rewards you all with a video clip that should delight the Jorja fans, because yes, that is Jorja playing the piano in this scene!

I'm going to limit these to once-a-day posts so I don't spend my WHOLE day running around, and instead just a couple hours of work for everything. That means there can be a bit of a lag between posts.  Don't think I've forgotten you!
