Riley sent me a lot of articles, some I didn't have, so I've started typing them up. While packing. And starting a new job. I'm ambitious.

Los Angeles Confidential talked to Jorja about her animals and animal-advocacy back in 2007.
<blockquote>**Jorja Fox** may have new mysteries to solve every week on _CSI_, but she has a kindhearted philosophy about animals all figured out.</blockquote>
