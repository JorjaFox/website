JORJA FOX

VIVA COVER GIRL AND STAR OF *CSI*

At the end of the day, if you are doing something you love, and if you can sleep at night, then that sets up a good equilibrium. An accomplishment and a restful night's sleep help to keep me stable. When I am out of balance, I either can't sleep or I can't get out of bed. To me, that's very telling that something is off.
