## Synopsis

A child is abducted. As the Amber Alert goes out, the entire team investigates in a race against time. Lindsay Willows is found hitchhiking to the alarm of Catherine.

## Review

Sara and Grissom work the angle of the missing child, and her personal possessions; Sara discovers the child's diary and her web browsing.

## Notes

* The quote below is only the second time that Grissom has ever complimented Sara, which sheds some light on their relationship.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Maybe. These are pretty detailed biochem and immunosuppressant citations. It's a little over a seventh grader's head, don't you think?
**Grissom:** I don't know. I bet you were a pretty smart seventh grader.
