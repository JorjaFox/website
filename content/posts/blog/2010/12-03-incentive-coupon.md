This comes from the idea (and work!) of @SMurfs31 who wondered if a coupon for the holidays would be nice for those of you who donated.

Print up this coupon, fill in a dollar amount in the middle, and tell people 'Instead of buying you something useless that'll be out of date in a year, I saved an animal for you!'

SMurfs31 did the design, Animal Acres gave us the logos, and I just put a border on it all.

If you want to make a better one, have at! I'd love to see them!
