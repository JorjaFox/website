## Synopsis

Russell's daughter, Maya (the mother of Kaitlyn who was once kidnapped

Hodges finds out that Rebecca was not just a kidnapped victim turned Stockholm, but the maker of the fake evidence strings the Gig Harbor boys used. In addition, she ran an escort service, from which the killers selected their victims. He and Morgan discover the bodies of the missing girls and Shaw's prints.

Shaw, working with the brothers, picks up Maya at the Russell house, but doesn't know Maya's wearing a wire. Maya had agreed to play bait. He plays the CSIs and absconds with Maya. Shaw turns out to be blackmailed by the Gig Harbor Brothers. He'd had a daughter (Amy) with Rebecca Lowell's sister, an escort, and Winthrope kidnapped her.

Shaw double crosses the brothers and kills Brisco, saving Maya and his daughter, but Winthrope was smarter and shoots him. As he's about to kill Shaw, Maya stabs Winthrope with a crowbar, brutally wounding him. But she doesn't kill him and Winthrope escapes. Shaw is arrested for his crimes, his daughter moving to live with her grandmother.

## Review

Sara is a little aghast at DB using his own daughter for bait.

## Quotes

**Sara Sidle** You came close, DB. The greater good. Brisco's dead and Winthrope's on the run, a fugitive. You can plaster his face everywhere. Freeze his accounts. You're in the driver's seat.
**DB Russell** Then why doesn't it feel like that?
