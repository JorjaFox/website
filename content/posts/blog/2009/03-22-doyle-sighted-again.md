Don't worry, you don't need to run out and watch the last episode of _ER_.  When Neela finally left the ER, Haleh took her down to the wall of departed doctors, we once again saw Doyle, remembered still, on the wall. Neela put her name just below Doyle.

Go in at the 2minute, 10second mark. Unless you're an ER fan.
