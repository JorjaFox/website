<h2>Official Release</h2>
A legendary comic from the good old days of Las Vegas is set to reunite with his partner on stage for one night only, until one half of the famous duo is found dead.

Special guest stars are Tim Conway, Jennifer Tilly and, of course, Jorja Fox.

<h2>Recap</h2>

Three stars, again. Not a _great_ ep for Jorja, but entertaining enough. Good screentime, fun plot.  Bobby Dawson (the ballistics guy) stole the show for me, though.
