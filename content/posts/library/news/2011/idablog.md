 On Saturday, June 11, activists in at least 24 cities around the world will take part in the International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos, holding outreach events and demonstrations to send the message that it's wrong to keep elephants in small zoo displays where these magnificent animals are suffering and dying prematurely. This year we're also offering a surprise co-event, but you'll have to stay tuned to this blog for more information later in the week.

IDA is delighted to announce that CSI's Jorja Fox (also seen in ER and West Wing) has joined Lily Tomlin in endorsing the International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos. Besides being a great actress, she's also a dedicated advocate for animals and offers these inspiring words:

"Jorja Fox here, asking you to please support this year's International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos! We need to put the focus where it belongs -- on protecting elephants in their natural habitats -- and stop wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on artificial zoo displays that will never meet their needs. Instead of cruel confinement and domination, let's offer sanctuary, peace, compassion and hope. It's up to each and every one of us to take a stand for the elephants now in order to ensure their welfare in captivity and their continued existence on this planet."
