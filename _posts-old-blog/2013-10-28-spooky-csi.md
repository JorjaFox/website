Knott's Scary Farm is something Knott's Berry Farm does every year, making it a spooktacular place. I never go. The only Haunted House I can go to and not be scared is Disney Land. I hate the people jumping out at me. However I love Elvira, and used to watch her all the time as a late night host when I was a child, because like Disney Land, she's not terrifying. She took horror and macabre and made it something I could face, because she was there. I think I saw her as a protecter. Well. Her and Count Von Count.

Elvira's famous dress came about after she was burned pretty badly in a fire as a child. Actually her whole fascination with spooky things comes from that. The dress covers the burns, which are over 53% of her body. Elvira's also an advocate for humanitarianism, gay rights, and animals.

Happy Halloween!
