## Synopsis

Connie helps a girl who is having a baby and is missing her boyfriend Jake, while Bobby meets an actress who models herself on Lauren Bacall and has driven her husband away with her constant role-playing games. Johnny is assigned desk duty after his father is investigated by internal affairs.

## Review

While interviewing Tamara Thorpe, the pregnant woman goes into labor and Connie rushes her to the hospital but it's a false alarm. The neighbors explain that Jake, the boyfriend, has been missing for at least four months.

## Notes

* Connie is awkward around babies.
