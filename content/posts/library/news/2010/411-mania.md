**- "CSI" premiere thoughts:** Man, where to freaking begin?

Okay, first the good stuff. Larry Fishburne enters his third season on the show with some goddamn attitude, something his Dr. Raymond Langston character has been missing since he started in 2008, and it's been great. Langston, still hurt from the prison attack that ended last season, walks around with a cane and a sneer, like he's telling the world "I am through with you all fucking with me!," which is just awesome. He's also much more confident at the crime scenes, and while he's still not Gil Grissom, he's become his own thing and that's just great. That vampire episode was brilliant, one of the best I've seen with Langston so far. Hopefully there are more of those kinds of episodes coming this season.

Marg Helgenberger seems to be trying very hard *not* to check out as this is her last season, which is a good thing. I imagine that she's going to become the focus of the show towards the end of the season so she can get the big send off. I do wonder, though, who is going to take her place on the show when she leaves. Will Jorja Fox's Sara take the lead female spot, or will the show create a new character, sort of like how "CSI: New York" did with Sela Ward? I'm not sure what I'd rather see. Will CBS allow Jerry Bruckheimer to hire another "name" actor?
