When it comes to procedural dramas, it's impossible not to think of _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_, the hit CBS TV series that has been on the air since 2000, kicking off one of television's most popular franchises. For 15 seasons, the show follows a group of crime-scene investigators from the Las Vegas Police Department as they work to solve murders using both investigative skills and science.

_CSI_ became a popular and critically acclaimed show that received, among several accolades, seven Primetime Emmy Awards and six Golden Globe nominations. In the wake of its popularity, CBS premiered _CSI: Miami_, _CSI: NY_, _CSI: Cyber_, and _CSI: Vegas_, a 2021 show that revived the 2000 series, featuring a number of actors from the original cast.

Currently, the show is due for its third season next February. Both the stars who rejoined the franchise in its most recent show and those who have not have remained involved in the industry over the years and took part in several major projects. Take a look at what the _CSI_ cast is doing now.

## Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle

**Jorja Fox** played analyst Sara Sidle, who, over the seasons, developed an on-again, off-again relationship with Gil Grissom. The actress was part of the main cast until Season 8, at which point she made a few cameo appearances before returning as a regular cast member from Season 11 until the finale. While this represents a major role in her career, it is not her biggest one: a few years earlier, Fox gained notoriety for playing Dr. Doyle on NBC's _ER_, as well as for her role as Gina Toscano on _The West Wing_.

Fox's career following her time on _CSI_ was packed with projects of all kinds. She devoted much of her time to activism, campaigning to promote vegetarianism and raising awareness of various issues surrounding animal suffering. She also launched herself as a stage producer, and was spotted as a cast member in the films _3022_ and _The Map of Tiny Perfect Things_. In 2021, Fox followed in her on-screen partner's footsteps and joined the cast of _CSI: Vegas_ in its first season, reprising her role as Sara Sidle.
