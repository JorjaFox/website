Everything is fine.  The scrapbook is moving along after a small snafu with the order (we ordered eco-friendly, 100% recycled sources, and got a <i>leather</i> bound book ... ).  Right now between work and home and the scrapbook I&apos;m behind on emails but everything is getting done

I have to ask that folks <b>not</b> email constantly asking for status or if they can help with the scrapbook.  I promised people that NO ONE but Jorja and I (to check for naughty letters) would read these letters, and I can&apos;t keep that promise if someone else gets to work on them. 

We&apos;re all doing fine, and the scrapbook will be sent out at the end of the month, which is as I had always planned.
