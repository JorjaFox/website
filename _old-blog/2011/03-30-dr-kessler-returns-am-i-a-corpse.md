<blockquote>"I had a conversation with Anthony [Zuiker, the show's creator] and was like 'Am I a corpse?'" laughs Clarke, who took a break from her role as ass-kicking madame Amanda on _Nikita_ to film the April 7 episode.  "Because it's always a possibility with that show.  He told me, 'No!  That would never happen!'  So I jumped at the chance to play her again."</blockquote>
The story goes on to tell us that she's working mostly with Langston (pity!) but Clarke thinks that Lady Heather's heart is "still with Grissom."
<blockquote>"There could be a wonderful episode in the future, where she has more to do with Sara [_Jorja Fox_] and Grissom," Clarke says.  "Anything is possible, so I'll put that out in the universe and see what happens."</blockquote>
