Welcome to everyone. Don and I are excited to be here and talk about the new season #CSI

"A TO Q" means "Answer to Question".

[..]

A TO Q: We've been talking to Jorja Fox about Sara and Grissom - Look for clues to where Grissom's been and where he's heading #CSI

[..]

A TO Q: Billy says Grissom has been working on perfecting his grilled cheese sandwiches. May surprise Sara with one. #CSI

[..]

A TO Q: Don says, we've talked about meeting Sara's mom since meeting Mrs Grissom. Maybe an episode called "The In-Laws" #CSI
