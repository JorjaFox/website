CBS has announced some scheduling stuff, some of which is important to CSI. Like we can pretty much be sure of the dates <em>CSI</em> will get bumped off the schedule thanks to football.

November 30, December 21, and December 28 are dates we <em>expect</em> to have our show bumped a night, due to footballers, based on this:
<blockquote><strong>CBS Sunday, Effective Nov. 30 (Football Doubleheader)</strong>
8:30-9:30 PM, ET/8:00-9:00 PM, PT MADAM SECRETARY
9:30-10:30 PM, ET/9:00-10:00 PM, PT THE MENTALIST (7th Season Premiere)
10:30-11:30 PM, ET/10:00-11:00 PM, PT CSI

<strong>CBS Sunday, Dec. 21 and 28 (Football Doubleheaders)</strong>
8:30-9:30 PM, ET/8:00-9:00 PM, PT UNDERCOVER BOSS
9:30-10:30 PM, ET/9:00-10:00 PM, PT THE MENTALIST
