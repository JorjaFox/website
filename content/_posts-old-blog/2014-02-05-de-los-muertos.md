<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9891" alt="Sara knows her concrete" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/02/vlcsnap-00004.jpg" width="300" height="168" />We took a week off of CSI (well ... CSI on the telly, <a title="JFO on CSI" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/jfo-csi/">last Wednesday had a lot of CSI</a>!) but now there's a new episode and yes, it has Jorja.

This case is mostly Doc Robbins and Nick down south of the border, but there will be Sara and Greg working the case back at home.

<em><span style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;">When the CSI team works two separate investigations, one involving a woman found murdered in Mexico and another of a local couple found dead in their driveway, they find the evidence in one case may help the other.</span></em>

And yes, that's George's wife.

I may be late with the recap and screencaps. I won tickets to a hockey game tonight, so I won't be able to watch the show till either very very late tonight or (more likely) tomorrow.
