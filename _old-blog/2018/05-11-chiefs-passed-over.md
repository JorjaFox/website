CBS has opted _not_ to put _Chiefs_ to series, making it a no-go for 2018-19.

The pilot, which starred Alana de la Garza, Jorja Fox and Aunjanue Ellis, focused on three female police chiefs in California, who band together to create a task force and catch a serial killer.

Oddly, CBS also passed on a _Cagney &amp; Lacey_ reboot, but picked up _Magnum PI_. Well. Maybe it's not that odd
