Behind only the Carol/Doug coda from _ER_ and the televised election of Barak Obama, the third **The Best of Top Moments** on TV this year goes to the **Best Goodbye**.

> With a new _CSI _(Laurence Fishburne) handpicked to join the team, Gil Grissom leaves the lab — and the show — with just a nod to Catherine Willows. But where's he going with such peaceful confidence? To the thick vegetation of a Costa Rican rain forest — and the arms of a smiling Sara Sidle.
