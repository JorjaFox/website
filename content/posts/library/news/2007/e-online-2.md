She's outta there.

That's what I can tell you about Jorja Fox's status on "CSI", the hit series that bested "Grey**s in the ratings last night.

As I mentioned on "E! News" on Wednesday [...], reliable sources close to the show tell me Jorja will not be a part of "CSI" as of the seventh episode of the current season.

So, do not let the fact that Sara Sidle survived last night's premiere fool you. Jorja, who suffered a second round of contract-negotiation difficulties (she was fired and rehired back in '04), will not be sticking around.

(By the by, my frenemy at TV Guide, Michael Ausiello, reported a similar story this morning--citing November as Jorja's end date. So, if his sources and my sources are sayin' the same thing, well...I think we may be on to something!)

Now, the question for you fellow "CSI" fans is whether you see this as a good thing or a stomach-churningly "terrible" thing for the show. Personally, I'm going for the latter, because I love Sara and will miss her dearly, but I also know some of you were deeply irked by the Sara-Grissom romance.
