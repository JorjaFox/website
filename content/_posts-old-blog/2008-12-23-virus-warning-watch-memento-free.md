Lately, I've seen a lot of ads for people to watch <em>Memento</em> online for free (after you watch a short advert, naturally).  So I thought I'd check one out to see if I could recommend any.  All I can recommend is <strong>DON'T</strong>.  I'm sure some of them out there are fine, but the four I checked all tried to put a virus on my Windows PC.  

Now I have not checked out endlessmovies or themoviedownloads, but given my experience on those other sites, I'm a little hesitant at suggesting them.  Alas, the best way to make sure you don't get infected is to go legit and pick up the movie on DVD yourself.

Have a safe and happy online holiday!
