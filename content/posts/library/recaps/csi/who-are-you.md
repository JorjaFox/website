## Synopsis

Catherine violates department protocol when she takes the case of a rape accusation against her ex-husband. Warrick and Sara search for the missing bullet that will either exonerate or indict a cop for murder. Grissom and Nick investigate when a female skeleton is found under a house buried in cement.

## Review

Sara and Warrick work the police shooting. At first, Sara is sympathetic towards the cop suspect, but later gets aggressive when questioning him when they discover that he has a round missing from his gun. When Warrick goes off against the cop, Sara doesn't jump in with him, but she doesn't pull him back, either.

## Notes

* Sara shows off her mechanical talents for the first time, helping Warrick to take the Jeep to pieces.
* Sara insists on driving, showing her need to take control.

**Warrick:** I don't give a damn what Brass likes.\
**Sara:** Like I do? If Tyner's dirty, he goes down. I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.

**Sara:** _(to Tyner)_ And with a record like yours we're supposed to just take you at your word?

**Sara:** You think the bullet's somewhere in the jeep.\
**Warrick:** It's not in the body. It's not at the crime scene. I like our odds.\
**Sara:** Let's do it.
