_The Sopranos_ won't air again until 2006, and George Eads and Jorja Fox, who were fired from the top-rated _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ for skipping work, will return to their hit show.

[...]

Eads and Fox will both be back on the job next week at *CSI *after learning a lesson in hardball network politics. Eads reached an agreement yesterday to return to television's most popular drama after he was fired for skipping work in what CBS thought was a contract dispute, CBS entertainment spokesman Chris Ender said. He rejoins Fox, who reached her agreement Thursday to come back. Eads was hired back at his old salary, a reported $100,000 an episode, said an executive close to the production.
