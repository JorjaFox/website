If you didn't get gut punched in the feels a little bit in this episode, you may want to keep your thoughts to yourself.

While the mystery wasn't 'deep' (I knew they were going to exonerate the dad, I suspected the taxidermist asshole the moment we saw him), it's episodes like this, where Jorja takes every single scene and hammers it out of the park with ease and grace that reminds me why, 18 years ago, I made a seemingly arbitrary choice to make a website for her. There's something about the way she drips disdain and vehemence at the right moments to make you find yourself nodding and agreeing with her, siding with Sara. And then when she looks so vulnerable and yet closed off at the end, when she still holds herself away from Greg a little, and his hand of friendship...

Sorry, it broke me a little. So did this photo:

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/dead-woods-recap-screencap/dead-woods-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-11781"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11781" src="//jfo-static.net/wordpress/2014/12/deadwoods_558-900x506.jpg" alt="Dead Woods" width="600" height="337" /></a>

It's a horrible thing for Sara to have to live with. Knowing she'll never know the truth, and knowing she'll never really be able to forgive her mother and move on. She will always be a little broken from this.

Clearly I had some trouble whittling down the images. Sorry.

Next week? Another CSI and yes, Jorja will be in it.
