Fans of TV drama CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION have started a grassroots online campaign to persuade departing castmember JORJA FOX to stay. Fox announced she was leaving the show in an interview with TV Guide magazine last month (Sep07), sending shockwaves through the programme's avid global fanbase. Her character, Sara Sidle, is a fan favourite and website DollarsForSense.com has been asking fans to send in letters voicing disapproval over Fox's departure. The unnamed fan behind the site then promised to forward on the letters to producers. He has already live up to his word - producers claim they've received over 3,000 unhappy letters from Sidle fans. Fox has been a regular on the show since 2000. She is quitting in November (07) after failing to agree terms on a new deal.
