The Huckleberry Foundation is named after Huckleberry Finn, an 11-year-old who ran away from home to escape the abuse of his alcoholic father.

This Foundation supports the youth programs of the Division of Adolescent Medicine, Childrens' Hospital Los Angeles, which reach out to the 'Huckleberry Finns' of today. For 20 years, the Division has led the way in providing integrated medical and psychological services to disadvantaged and disconnected youth of Los Angeles.

Part of the Huckleberry Fund Benefit is an annual auction; photographs by amateurs and professionals are auctioned off, with the money going to the hospital. Twice now (2003, 2004) Jorja has contributed photographs to the auction.
