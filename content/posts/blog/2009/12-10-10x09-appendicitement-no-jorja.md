<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/appendicitement-100x100.jpg" alt="appendicitement" title="appendicitement" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2147" /> On this episode of CSI, Henry celebrates his birthday in a biker bar - well, because Nick (George Eads), Greg (Eric Szmanda) and Hodges (Wallace Langham) brought him there. And then they realize a double homicide took place there, and the people inside may be the suspects.

Anyone want to have a caption contest for the image in this post?

I'll put one out there:
Ray: Who thought it was a good idea to let Sara go to Paris again?
Catherine: She reminded Ecklie she could kill him and no one would ever find his body.
