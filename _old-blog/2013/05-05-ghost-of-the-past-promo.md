Sorry about the promo quality. I'm not sure what's going on with CBS, since they suddenly pulled their promos and sneak peeks off of the web for "Fearless" (they worked Thursday last). Not allowing us to be able to embed the video makes no sense since we're advertising their show for them... I don't know what they're smoking.
