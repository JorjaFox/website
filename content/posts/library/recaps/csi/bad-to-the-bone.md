## Synopsis

A violent murder in a casino parking garage and another episode in the police interview room lead the CSIs to one shocking discovery after another. The case involves a missing woman, a long dead body and a missing child.

## Review

Sara has very little to do in this ep, and is fairly low key throughout it. She and Nick review the casino video tapes, and discover the suspect 'snaking' (stealing chips from) the victim. Later they investigate the suspect's car, and Nick shows that envelope and discovers that it's postmarked Henderson, which leads them to the suspect's sister.

**Nick:** Burn holes.\
**Sara:** The guy takes on five cops in their house. Makes you wonder what he might have done to a waitress.
