TWO stars of the American hit television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation have reportedly been sacked for breach of contract.

Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes, were apparently fired after asking for more money to stay on the Emmy-nominated show.

Eads didn't show up for work yesterday, the first day of production for the next season, according to Variety.

The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts. Danica Smith, publicist for both Fox and Eads, said Fox was sacked on Wednesday but did not have details. Smith could not confirm whether Eads was sacked.

Though a search was under way for their replacements, it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones, the reports said.

A spokesman for television network CBS refused to comment.
