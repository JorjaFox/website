Math is funny.

Jorja first showed up on ER in October 1996, which technically is 19 years ago. But she did 3 seasons of ER, 1 of The West Wing, 15 of CSI, and then the upcoming CSI TV movie. Which adds up to 20 seasons. If you want to look at it a different way, Jorja has been on TV pretty much every year since 1992 (if you count the pilot of "Courthouse", which few people have seen).

That's an insane record. But any way you paint it, she's been been on our screens for a long time.

273 episodes of CSI plus one movie. In 16 days I'll be up in Beverly Hills and see what we have in store for us and I'll say goodbye to a big chunk of my TV life.

It's been a great TV run. I can't wait to see what Jorja does next.
