First up, mobile users can now use the main blog easier thanks to WPTouch.  Looks great on iPad and iPhone and (I hope) all other mobile devices.  Let me know if not.

Secondly, IE 8 users can now see the gallery.  The issue was with IE 8 being an idiot, so I made a tweak and it should now work for all IE users.  Now that said, to those of you <em>still</em> on IE 8, I understand upgrading to Windows 7 may not be possible.  If that's the case, I strongly suggest you grab Chrome.  It's small, fast and works great on XP.  Opera also still supports those of you trapped on Win 95.  I know buying a new computer is expensive (I had to this year, and it hurts), but at a certain point, you won't be able to see the cool stuff here and on CBS.

The Gallery and JorjaPedia don't have a good/easy mobile solution yet.  MediaWiki (what I use to run the JorjaPedia) is working on one.  Zenphoto (gallery software) has a plugin, but there are issues with that and caching and I'd rather have the site run faster.

Ad-Free is still closed, but we're getting better results off the current ad setup.  <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com/">Project Wonderful</a> is pretty cool and lets me have 100% control over the ads.  If you see something offensive that I missed, please <a title="Contact JFO" href="https://jorjafox.net/contact/">contact me</a> right away and I'll look into it (remember to tell me <em>which</em> ad is the bad guy).  The donations link remains open for anyone who just has a wild hair.  They are not tax deductible (sorry), but they do things like pay for hosting.  I've looked into 'sponsorship' type setups, but given the random nature of content, it's hard to justify things that way.

</center>Finally, the poll about BuddyPress/Social Stuff is still open and is surprisingly close. Please vote if you haven't.  Right now, people are leaning towards wanting <em>something</em> social, so I may do a follow-up vote to clarify things and sort out what you want.
