**Melissa Rivers** Thank you. I am here with the cast of CSI. Your show has taken off, like, y'know. A train, just steaming right out of the station.

**Jorja Fox** We're dazed. We're dazed and confused and so happy and yeah! It's great.

**Melissa Rivers** I see Marg has gotten a lot of attention for the show for the last, what? For last season.

**Jorja Fox** Yeah.

**Melissa Rivers** But now the whole show is being acknowledged tonight.

**Robert David Hall** It's the great chemistry. It's a lot of fun to go to work.

**Melissa Rivers** Now did anyone, did any of you get offers, or did everyone have to sort of go through the whole process?

**Jorja Fox** They actually made us all audition, I think. Anyone-

**Mrs. Hall** Except for Billy Petersen.

"(everyone laughs)"

**Melissa Rivers** How many times- How many times did you have to come back?

**Paul Guilfoyle** Twice.

**Jorja Fox** Two times, yeah.

**Eric Szmanda** Two.

**Gary Dourdan** Oh they already hired me like months before, yeah.

**Melissa Rivers** Now, and you shoot on location in Vegas.

**Jorja Fox** Yes.

**Melissa Rivers** How much fun is Vegas?

**Jorja Fox** It's hard to concentrate sometimes.

**Gary Dourdan** Vegas is it's own character, you know. Vegas, Vegas- We don't have to do anything, it does itself, so...

**Melissa Rivers** Do you still, like, walk to the casinos and go 'Oh, I'm gonna go out tonight,' or is it more is it just like 'eh it's Vegas'? Cause I spent a lot of time there, growing up, when my mom was working there, and you kind of get numb to the whole thing.

**Jorja Fox** There are certain ones of us here who have to have their money held for them.

**Melissa Rivers** Ahhh.

**Jorja Fox** I won't mention any names "(points to Gary, George and herself)" but they're here.

**Melissa Rivers** We'll save that for the ending interview, how about that? Cause I have a feeling you guys are all going to be nominated for that. Thank you so much for stopping and best of luck tonight.
