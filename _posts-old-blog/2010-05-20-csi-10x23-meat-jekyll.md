I'll update the post later tonight once I have screencaps etc. Please note, I'm not getting home until **AFTER** _CSI _airs tonight, so I'll be rather late on this one.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
The CSI's lives are on the line as they close in on the elusive Dr. Jekyll, and more than one member of the team may not live to see his capture.

<h2>Recap</h2>
<del datetime="2010-05-21T03:43:24+00:00">_Coming Soon!_</del>

Got home right as CSI ended and watched it on the DVR and ... I'm totally underwhelmed.  Misinformation is the name of CBS's game.  We never got Hannah, we never found out why Sara was in Vegas (by which I mean **staying** in Vegas).  The only thing they came through on was saying the season would end with a cliff hanger.  And even that we're all pretty sure Ray will live.  So.  Three stars for many Sara scenes, but that's it.  In any other season, this would have been two stars. That's how bad the ep was for Sara.

Overall, I give this season three stars for Sara, considering she's a guest star.
