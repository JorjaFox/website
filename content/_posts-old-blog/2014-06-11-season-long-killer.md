Yesterday Michael Ausiello noted that we get a <a href="http://tvline.com/2014/06/10/castle-season-7-spoilers-time-jump-rick-car-crash/">season long killer</a>:
<blockquote><strong>Question: Anything you can spill on the new season of <em>CSI</em>? —Missi</strong>

<strong>Ausiello:</strong> A major serial killer storyline will permeate Season 15, and it will dredge up old (and extremely unpleasant) memories for Russell (Ted Danson).</blockquote>
But of course the CSI Writers Room has other plans already:

They have my attention, though I know that the killer will be aimed at Ted all season.

By the way, a massive thank you to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/csi-showrunner-carol-mendelsohn-exits-711124">departing Carol Mendelsohn</a>. You made CSI awesome and I  know I'll miss your wit and art. Best wishes to wherever you end up, and I hope you know you will be missed greatly.
