<div style="float:left;padding:5px">[polldaddy poll=3561021]</div> July was pretty busy in Jorja World, so let's hit them in order!

<h2>Jorja Stuff</h2>
Jorja was interviewed by <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorja-on-jane-velez-mitchell-tonight/">Jane Velez-Mitchell on her show ISSUES</a>, which we later got a small <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/clip-of-jorja-on-issues/">video clip of it</a> as well as a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/issues-screencaps-and-clip/">second clip of a ... clip show</a>.

Then <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/happy-42nd-birthday-jorja/">Jorja turned 42</a>!

Marg decided to stay on _CSI_ (though this will be her final season), and for a while all we knew was that <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/marg-stays-jorja-in-talks/">Jorja was in talks</a>.  Finally we got the news that <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/jorjas-in-for-season-11/">Jorja's staying on CSI for one more season at least</a> and she even <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/stunt-womans-butt-kicked-by-jorja/">kicked a stuntwoman's backside</a> (even if I did have to remind y'all that <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/facebook-rumors-are-unconfirmed/">Facebook rumors were just rumors</a>.  That said, a lot of people wonder <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/ask-matt-where-is-grissom/">where is Grissom?</a> At the CBS press tour, they promised (again) to explain the whole Long Distance stuff, but <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/keck-on-the-cbss-2010-press-tour/">Grissom's not coming back any time soon</a>.

Randomly, I got some more <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/lion-pictures-bad-movies/">photos of Jorja and the lions, and posted it with some clips of bad movies</a>.  We also got some news about <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/accidental-icon-to-air-at-the-2010-fgff/">Accidental Icon airing at a film festival</a>.  The ADI published Jorja's <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/press-address-for-adi-on-the-lion-rescue/">press address the day the lions were released</a>, and even tweeted me about it.

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/artists-and-athletes-alliance-on-the-gulf/">Artists and Athletes talked about the Gulf Crisis</a> (complete with a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/btc-aaa-host-philippe-cousteau/">video clip</a>, and <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/twitchhiker-almost-met-jorja/">the Twitchhiker almost met Jorja</a>.

Last, but not least, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/eric-szmanda-jadore-flirter-avec-jorja-fox/">Eric Szmanda admitted he likes to flirt with Jorja</a>, and CSI's newest cast member, Sienna Guillory, admitted <a href="http://twitter.com/guillorybe/status/19304608158">she has a girl crush on Jorja</a>:

<h2>JFO Stuff</h2>
The No Ads idea has worked okay. Enough that it'll stick around. The revenue from the other ads balance out everything, so if you want to kill an ad for everyone, great. If not, we're still good.

The fundraising for <a href="https://jorjafox.net/birthday/">Jorja's Birthday</a> concludes at the end of this month, so you still have time to donate.
