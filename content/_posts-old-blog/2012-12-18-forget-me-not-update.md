Ready for spoilers? I mean ... something that will make you flip your wig? Are you <em>sure</em><em>?</em>

From <a href="http://talk.csifiles.com/showpost.php?p=1235723&amp;postcount=532">Micha</a> comes the best news I've had in a while:
<blockquote>Mrs. Sidle is Saraâ€™s mom, the victim of a very hard life, she was an alcoholic, she has been transported from a care home to the hospital due to alcohol poisoning. A bit confused, but apologetic, she has no idea that she is a pawn in the machinations of a nefarious plot to sabotage Sara. Nonetheless, she is delighted to see her daughter, hopeful she can visit more often.</blockquote>
Dude, I am so happy and I hope this pans out! The world better not end on the 21st.
