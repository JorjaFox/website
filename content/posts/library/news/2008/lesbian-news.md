Jorja Fox and Kirsten Holly Smith talk about the life and music of Dusty Springfield.

For millions the music and life of Dusty Springfield has grand significance. More specifically, as a woman who was producing music in the man's world of music making, a performer who professionally protested Apartheid (before it was de rigueur) and a household name who came out of the closet, Springfield's music and life meant much more to specific groups such as women, blacks and gays. She was truly an iconoclastic artist whom succeeded and failed on her own terms.

Although she died of cancer in 1999, Springfield's modus vivendi lives on in the likes of television and film actor Jorja Fox and actor, writer and singer Kirsten Holly Smith. Friends for years, Fox and Smith found out they wanted to bring Springfield's life to the world - even though they did not realize they were on the same wavelength until Smith invited Fox to her one-night show on Springfield written and performed by Smith. Immediately smitten with the project Fox decided to back the production.

Directed by Derick LaSalla and backed by a live band and backup singers, Smith will perform her (with additional material by Patricia Cotter) Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield February 7-24 at the Renberg Theatre in the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center's Village at Ed Gould Plaza.

A world premiere featuring 13 Springfield songs (e.g. "Son of a Preacher Man" and "Wishing and Hoping") Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield chronicles Springfield's days as a wayward teenager to her rise and falls and rises to and fro stardom.

Born July 7, 1968, in New York, New York, to Canadian émigrés the 5-foot 9-inches Fox was a fashion model from Florida before she began to study acting back in New York and becoming one of television's most noticeable new faces with her appearances as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing, and the 170 episodes (and counting) as Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

Off the hyper-melodrama television past, Fox eats vegetarian, supports vegan products (Matt and Nat named a purse after Fox) has pets, writes songs, plays guitar and is a co-founder of the experimental theater LA-based production company "Honeypot Productions" along with the pro-Sapphic songstress of the Murmurs, Heather Grody. (Who wants to guess where they got the theater's name? Go Fish.).

Along with Fox LN also spoke to the tall beauteous blonde Smith (as she was applying stage makeup), whose film credits include Isle of Lesbos and the upcoming Ninja Cheerleaders.

Lesbian News: Why did you want to put on this show?

Jorja Fox: I've always been a big fan of Dusty Springfield. Even many years ago I read her story and found it interesting. I wanted to turn it into a screenplay. Kirsten, who I've known for years, called me and told me she was doing this show about Dusty Springfield. I was like, "Wow, ain't that a small world." So I went to see the show. I felt instantly in love. It was stunning, magical, and breathtaking. So I offered to get on board and now I'm the latest on this party train. Dusty Springfield is an iconic figure in music history. She was a pioneer in so many ways. Not only musically, but business sense, taking a political stand on certain issues, and she herself is exciting and amazing. I wanted to tell the story and I'm totally thrilled I get to tell it with Kirsten.

Lesbian News: Could you elaborate on why it is time to tell this story?

Jorja Fox: It's always been time to tell this story. She was a very brave person, a visionary, and she really stuck to her ideals. I don't think she ever compromised her ideals. If ever - not just the world in general, but in entertainment - we could get something out of who she was, it's right now for sure.

[...]

Lesbian News: Jorja, you mentioned her political stances.

Jorja Fox: She took a very early stand against segregation in South Africa or Apartheid. When she went to South Africa she had a standard clause that she wouldn't play to segregated audiences. After years of dodging questions about her sexual orientation, sometime in the 70's she grew tired of it and she started to be a little more direct with press. If I'm not mistaken, she was the first musician who was able to say to a reporter, "Yeah, maybe I do sleep with women. I enjoy the company of women just as much as I enjoy the company of men".

Lesbian News: How did her coming out of the closet free her of her artistic talent?

[...]

Jorja Fox: Homosexuality, especially for men, was illegal in England until 1967. So the fact that she got into the press about it in the early 70's is pretty cool.

Lesbian News: What do you think you have in common with Dusty?

[...]

Jorja Fox: I don't know if I have a lot in common with Dusty Springfield, but she certainly is one of my heroes and mentors.

Lesbian News: In what way is she one of your mentors?

Jorja Fox: She was always true to her art. She followed her passion for art. She made a living at it. That was sometimes difficult. As Kirsten pointed out, there are ways to market people and ways to sell people and Dusty didn't quite fit into an exact niche group. She kind of stood up and did what she did and hoped that people would enjoy the music. She had great business sense. She took a hold of her career and took the risks to steer it.

Lesbian News: As someone who has been in the limelight, in what ways does celebrity influence creativity?

Jorja Fox: That's a loaded question right there "(laughs)". Celebrity can sometimes be challenging to creativity because it's easier for any artists out there to take risks if they're not already threatened by security or stability. As an actor, personally, I don't think anyone should ever feel comfortable. It doesn't matter how successful you get or how high you go, we all know there are flavors of the month, flavors of the year, and how quickly the tide can change. If I'm starting to feel comfortable, that's a warning sign "(laughs)". I would need to reevaluate.

Lesbian News: Along the lines of what we have been talking about with regard to media and celebrity, what do you think about these interviews where you talk about yourself and your work? Do they serve the work? Should the work speak for itself? Why do you do them?

Jorja Fox: I don't do a lot of interviews. I'm lucky enough to have been on TV every week for the past 7 1/2 years. I feel people get a lot of me already so I don't want overdo it. I would always much rather let the work talk. As an actor the less people know about you the easier it is to suspend the believability of the person you're playing or trying to portray.

Kirsten Holly Smith: Are you talking about The Actor's Studio "(laughs)". I absolutely think the work should speak for itself. I don't think it serves the work at all. It serves the ability for a person to see the story and come see the work.

Jorja Fox: Right.
