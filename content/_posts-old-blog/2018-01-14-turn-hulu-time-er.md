All fifteen seasons ofÂ <a href="http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/er-streaming-hulu-deal-330-episodes-1202664169/"><em>ER</em> will be available on Hulu</a> as of today!

That's over 330 episodes, stat! Of course, you probably only want to watch the Jorja(n) Fox episodes. And you know I've got your back for that.

<strong><a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/er-episodes/">I have a list of ER episodes in which Jorja appears.</a></strong>

In honor of this special occasion, I've gone through that list of ER episodes and updated the episode descriptions so you can remember which is which.

Happy binging!
