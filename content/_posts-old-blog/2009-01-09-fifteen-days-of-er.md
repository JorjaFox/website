The Chicago SunTimes is having a <strong>Fifteen Days of ER</strong> theme going on, but for the Jorja Fan,  there's not a lot here.

<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/1363207,CST-FTR-er06a.article">'ER:' Season 3 summary</a> mentions the obvious "Dr. Maggie Doyle joins staff."

And did I mention the clip reel?The highlight reel actually has a lot of Doyle in it.  Extra points if you can spot the other CSI star. Oh, and yes, they put in the scene with Doyle and Carter at the firing range.
