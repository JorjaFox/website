Confession: I have never purposefully watched an episode of CSI. Or any of its spinoffs.

[...]

6. Sarah and Catherine, are they frenemies? I feel tension? I feel history? Tempted to Google, but that feels like cheating.

[...]

11. Wait, Sarah and Petersen were MARRIED?! Is that why there was tension with her and Marg's character?! Love it.

[...]

14. Sarah and Gil's (I'll call him that from now on, not Petersen) first encounter. Tension's so thick you can cut it with a shark fin. Ted Danson also meets him for the first time and I had no idea there wasn't ever any crossover with them.

15. Thanks for all the exposition, Sarah. Caught up on their relationship drama. "Seeing you again left me a little speechless," is a pretty good line.

[...]

31. Oh, so I guess Catherine and Gil were NOT a thing? So my Gil shipping order currently is 1. Lady Heather. 2. Catherine. 3. Sarah. Sorry, not sorry.

32. Sarah getting the swabs from the suspects' mouths is the most I've liked her.

[...]

35. Sarah still loves Gil. Lady Heather doesn't love Gil. I guess I have to update my ranking. Sigh.

[...]

37. Ha, Gil is reprimanding the bees. He's a wonderful weirdo. Sarah interrupts and they have A MOMENT.

38. And Gil's wearing another hilarious hat, albeit this is for bee-keeping. And Sarah is wearing one, too. Bow-chicka-wow-wow. Also, how are bees now an integral part of this case? I'm confused.

[...]

46. "Vegas is lucky to have you." "The oceans are lucky to have you." Deep. "I hope you find what you are looking for out there!" BUT HE'S ALREADY FOUND IT.

47. Gil and Lady Heather have quite the goodbye. Why he loves Sarah? "She helped me with my crossword puzzles." True love right there, people. But he says he's going to miss her for the rest of his life. Or you could just be together? Why do you need to be such a drama queen, you can be with her!

48. Sarah went to him! I love that they chose not to have the actors say anything. So much more powerful with no words.

49. And then they rode off into the sunset.
