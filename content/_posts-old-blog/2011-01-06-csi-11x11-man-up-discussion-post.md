Right now we don't know for 100% assuredness that Jorja's even in this episode (and believe me, I wouldn't subject you to Carrot Top unless I have to!) but she's listed in the press release so I'll give this a 90% chance she's in the episode.  I do not expect this to be a big Jorja Heavy episode.  You'll have to wait till Feburary's "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" for that one.

<h3>Official Release</h3>
The CSIs question the validity of an online picture depicting a murdered call girl until they find the same woman strangled to death in the dumpster that appears in the photo.
