<strong>Drop Dead Diva</strong>
There was a surprising kerfluffle over Jorja not being mentioned in the <em>Drop Dead Diva</em> trailers for her episode, and some people decided it clearly meant that her episode had been postponed. I want to remind people that the final authority in any tidbit is the show itself. Spoilers, previews, etc are all subject to change up until the day of airing, and what TPTB feel are important aren't always what fans find important. Take everything, even spoilers I share here, with a grain of salt. The world is subject to change.

In the end, it was no surprise to me that "Second Chances" aired as planned. Seeing Jorja as a suburban housewife criminal was interesting. If you missed it, we have <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Drop_Dead_Diva">a recap</a>, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/guest/drop-dead-diva/secondchances/">screencaps</a> and selected clips.

<strong>CSI</strong>
We get closer and closer, and spoilers are out there.  So as not to spoil the people who don't want it, I suggest you stroll through the Spoiler Section and catch up on anything you missed.  There have also been some pictures, which are all up in the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/pub/s10">Season 10 publicity gallery</a> and a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/08/28/10x01-family-affair-promo-1-bad-quality/">low quality trailer</a>.  Finally, if you haven't yet, go to TV Guide Magazine and post your questions for Jorja and Marg before it's too late! 

<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
With the release of Jorja's professional/resume site, <a href="http://jorjafox.com">JorjaFox.com</a>, we finally got the chance to see a clip from "<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/The_True_Story">The True Story</a>".  Which means we've now got <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/guest/the-true-story/">screencaps</a> for you!
