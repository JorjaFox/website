<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3425" title="1113-2mrs05" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/1113-2mrs05-100x100.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" />Starting Wednesday, June 29th, _CSI_ will be airing on Wednesday.  I know this isn't a shock to you, since you've known our show was moving, but here's the happy part.  They're re-airing "The Two Mrs. Grissoms."  Yeah, I know!  The **only** episode I've ever gone out of my way to re-watch will re-air.  And of course I'll be on vacation that week.

Here's the schedule:
<ul>
	<li>"418/427" - June 29</li>
	<li>"Pool Shark" - June 30</li>
	<li>"Man Up" - July 6 (no Jorja in this one)</li>
	<li>"The Two Mrs. Grissoms" - July 13</li>
</ul>
