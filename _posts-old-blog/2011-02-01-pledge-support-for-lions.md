**Bob Barker, Jorja Fox and a Pride of Celebrities Pledge Their Support to ADI’s Record Breaking Lion Rescue, Urging People to Give to the Appeal**

We all know Jorja's hugely incolved in protect the lions, get them out of the circus and into some place safe.  Well, ADI has 25 more lions and they need more help to get them here, and finish building their 80 acre sanctuary! Here's what Jorja had to say:

<blockquote>CSI actress and ADI Ambassador, Jorja Fox said: "I hope you'll join me in supporting Operation Lion Ark. These majestic animals have been through so much and now through the compelling and daring acts of ADI, they are finally going to have a life of ease, dignity, and grace. We'd love for you to be a part of this amazing and unprecedented epic event.”
