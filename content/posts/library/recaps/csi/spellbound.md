## Synopsis

Grissom and his team investigate the case of psychic Sedona Wiley who envisioned her own death. During a 'reading' with two young women (Anah Leah and Lori from Evaluation Day), the psychic begins to see visions of her own murder instead of information pertaining to her clients. When she is later found dead in her occult shop, it is up to the CSI team to determine her true cause of death. Greg, who reveals to Grissom that an expertise in the 'occult' runs in his family, suspects greater forces may be responsible for the woman's demise.

Meanwhile, a retired cop who used the psychic for help on a 15 year old case of Claire Wallace, believes the suspect in his cold case is the killer. Brass and Grissom agree to reopen the case, and discover the psychic used extortion with other people. Following the psychic's advice, they uncover the body of the long dead wife from the cold case, and subsequently determine that Claire's husband, Gordon, did in deed kill Sedona, believing that she had psychically uncovered that he had killed his wife.

Grissom, who has steadfastly maintained that science will always crack the case in the end, shows Greg Sedona's 'death' book, in which she has written generic phrases to use when speaking of the dead. One of those phrases clued the retired cop into where he should be looking, but only by the power of suggestion..
