## Animals in entertainment

Jorja Fox joined ADI when they went to Austin, Texas to look into the issue of circus animal cruelty in Austin. Meeting with City Hall, Jorja Fox presented the Council with scientific evidence and video proof of the mistreatment of animals in the circus. Accepting a letter, report and DVD from Jorja Fox, on behalf of the campaigning group, the City Council agreed to research and consider a ban on animal circuses in light of the evidence presented by ADIs report and undercover footage.

## Bolivian Lion Rescue

In May of 2010, Jorja took part in the ADI rescue of former circus lions from Bolivia. Working with ADI San Francisco, Jorja assisted with the media releases, as well as being on hand when the lions were brought to San Francisco.

## Operation: Lion Ark

On February 16th, 2011, Jorja was on hand with Bob Barker when the rescue of 25 lions from Bolivia was completed. Both Jorja and Bob personally funded the rescue of the former circus lions.

## Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act

On November 2nd, 2011, Jorja and Bob Barker went to Washington DC to address Congress about the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act, which has been introduced to prevent circuses from using exotic (non-native) animals. When the bill came back up in 2017, Jorja again went to DC.
