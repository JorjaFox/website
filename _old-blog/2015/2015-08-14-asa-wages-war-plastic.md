The ASA is the American Sailing Association, and they've had enough about plastic in our oceans.

<blockquote>From the shores of Hawaii, and the shores of the mainland the Mega Expedition begins...

As part of The Ocean Cleanup, 24 sailboats look to collect more plastic measurements in 3 weeks than have been collected in the past 40 years combined. This is the largest research effort every to asses the amount of harmful plastic pollution in our oceans. Through this mission and other strategies The Ocean Cleanup looks to substantially reduce the amount of toxic plastic in the ocean over the next 10 years.

Crews have undergone training, custom made equipment for collection has been installed. And maybe most importantly, young Boyan Slat, the innovator who has masterminded this enormous undertaking, has been suitably blessed in a Polynesian ceremony.

The American Sailing Association will be receiving information as it happens from the notorious Pacific Garbage Patch where so much of these plastics congregate. The Ocean Cleanup coordinator, Stella Diamant, will be doing satellite interviews with ASA from the area - detailing what they are seeing and how their historic missing is progressing.
