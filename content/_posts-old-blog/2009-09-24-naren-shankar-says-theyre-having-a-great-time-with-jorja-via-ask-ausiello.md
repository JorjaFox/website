<blockquote><strong>Question: What&#8217;s this I hear about some unexpected surprise coming out in the <em>CSI</em> premiere about Sara? —Encarni<br />Ausiello:</strong> <a href="http://www.people.com/people/videos/0,,20306231,00.html">She got hitched to Grissom when no one was looking</a>. But that&#8217;s old news. Here&#8217;s some (relatively) new news from exec producer Naren Shankar: &#8220;Do not miss the first two-and-a-half minutes of <em>CSI</em> season premiere. It will blow your mind. It may be one of the most incredible things we&#8217;ve ever put on film. It&#8217;s so beautiful and it&#8217;s so cool.&#8221;

<strong>Question: Any chance Jorja Fox may stick around full-time on <em>CSI</em>? Five episodes isn&#8217;t enough. —Brian<br />Ausiello:</strong> I posed that question to Shankar, and, based on his evasiveness, I would say it&#8217;s probably being discussed. &#8220;I honestly can&#8217;t say [for sure] at this point,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;All I will say is we&#8217;re having a great time and I think Jorja is having a great time. I think she&#8217;s having more fun now than she did before. Having a little space from something, you get to clean your palate and be refreshed as an artist.&#8221;</blockquote>
