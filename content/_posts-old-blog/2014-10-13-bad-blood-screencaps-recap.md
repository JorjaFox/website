Lets start with five stars, shall we?

Once she was suited up in the CDC garb, Sara was looking around like every single view was the last she'd have of whatever it was. And let's not forget that thoughtful/sad look when Greg called his grandmother. Who was she thinking about seeing? Well, maybe she was just sick. Oh yeah, that passing out was brilliant. I rewound a bunch of times. The whole thing was well done, and all I missed was Sara calling her mother or something... Maybe not her mother, Laura's nutters.

Also there's a nice review from Zap2It: <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/csi_season_15_episode_3_ebola-2014-10">'CSI' justifies intense Ebola fears with rural outbreaks</a>

Here's something to think about... that episode was written months ago and I promise you, the ebola mentions were in there from day one. Pretty awesome timing.

What did you think about this week's <em>CSI</em>?

There's no Jorja in next week's <em>CSI</em>, so I'll take a week off and catch up on sleep!
