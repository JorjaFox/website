_This is Elisabeth Shue's first episode as Julie 'Finn' Finlay_

## Synopsis

A shot man, Wes Clybourn, crashes into a billboard near where the CSIs are eating. The man lives, but was shot in the head and has limited memory of the event, or why the blood of multiple victims is found on his shirt. DB Reaches out to a former coworker, Julie 'Finn' Finlay, asking her to come help. The convoluted case involves two missing women, a missing ex-con, and a father and son having an affair with the same women, though not at the same time. When two more bodies are found in a warehouse, Finn recreates the crime scene in the lab and determines that Wes was actually the killer.
