Lists inspire debate and remind us of our favorite people and events. Oh, and there's one other cool thing about lists: they give us an excuse to drool over dozens of the sexiest women in television.

Of course, that's only true if you happen to be doing a list like, say, The 50 Hottest Girls on Television; it won't work if it's a list of Best Carburetors. Luckily, our list actually is about sexy women, complete with photos of these ladies in all their slobber-inducing splendor.

So get your spittoon and settle back, because we're about to blow your little mind.

**Showing 37 of 50**

**Jorja Fox**

Look, it's not that we don't like William Peterson or his character Gil Grissom on *CSI*. Gil seems like a cool enough dude and everything. But seriously, isn't he a little gray for sexy forensic scientist Sara Sidle? He's, like, almost old enough to be her father.

That's why we've decided that the departure of Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, is actually a good thing. Firstly, it gives Fox more free time to appear on things like this list of the sexiest women on television, where she's a respectable number 37. It also gives her the chance to explore other romantic options; if she wanted to hook up with a freelance writer, for instance, she could totally do that by emailing UGO.com.

Alas, it looks like Fox will actually be returning to *CSI* next season. Good news for viewers; bad news for us.
