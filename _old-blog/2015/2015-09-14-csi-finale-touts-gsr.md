Both the longer and shorter videos show it.

<blockquote>The first teaser trailer for CSI‘s two-hour finale event (CBS, Sept. 27) promises to tie up any loose ends from the procedural’s 15-season run — including Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom’s uncertain romantic future.

“Do you love him?” Lady Heather (guest-star Melinda Clarke) asks Sidle, to which Sidle tearfully replies, “I do.” That exchange, coupled with a shot of Sidle approaching Grissom on a boat, should offer suffering fans quite a bit of hope.

Additionally, the new teaser gives us a glimpse of other CSI cast members — including Ted Danson as D.B. Russell and Marg Helgenberger as Catherine Willows — returning for duty.</blockquote>
