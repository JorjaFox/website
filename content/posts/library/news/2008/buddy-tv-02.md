"CSI" fans have not seen the last of Sara Sidle. In fact, the time has come for fans to welcome one of the key players of the forensic drama, Jorja Fox, whose character left the series in the season 7 episode "Goodbye and Good Luck" where she had to go face the ghost of her past.

According to "TV Guide", the 39-year-old actress has just inked a deal to return for "CSI**s ninth season premiere next fall. Not much has been revealed about her anticipated comeback as plot details are being kept under wraps for now. However, it has been reported that she "won't be appearing in a flashback."

In line with this, speculations have surged that Fox's return to the forensic drama has something to do with the mourning of Warrick (Gary Dourdan), who was shot and presumably killed in the season 8 finale. On the other hand, these are all just presumptions given that "CSI" boss Carol Mendelsohn hinted in the latest issue of "TV Guide" that Dourdan will be back in the fall and "not just in flashbacks."

Fox, who is also credited for her work on "ER" and "The West Wing", joined CSI in 2000 and was known as materials and element analyst and eventually the love interest of Gil Grissom (William Petersen). In 2004, she got caught up in a controversy when she was reportedly fired from the forensic drama for allegedly failing to submit a letter to CBS for confirming that she would be on time for shooting. The dispute was resolved in just over a week and Fox was rehired by the network. Early last year, the news about her possible departure on the show emerged and despite fans' efforts to keep her on the program, Fox decided that season 8 will be her last.
