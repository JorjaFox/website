Please consider contributing to <a href="http://iworry.org">iWorry</a> and say **no** to ivory.

<blockquote>Last year up to **36,000** elephants were killed for their ivory. **1** life lost every **15 minutes.
**At the current rate of poaching African Elephants could face extinction in the wild by **2025.**

Join us as we peacefully march in 15 cities around the world on **Friday 4th October**.
You can also show your support by joining the digital march for elephants.

Support the DSWT's iworry campaign and be a part of a global effort to protect and preserve elephants.</blockquote>

The International March for Elephants is Friday October 4th.
