# Fans of LeFox

Due to unforeseen circumstances, we've been forced to change the site.

## Powered By

* [System: Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Theme: Hinode](https://gethinode.com)

## Installation

* Checkout from Github
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run mod:update`

To build the site, run `npm run build`

To upgrade the backend site code, run `npm run upgrade`

## Development

When the `production` branch is updated, it will automatically push the code to the server.

1. Create a new branch to work on based on `production`.
2. Test locally using `npm run start`
3. Push branch to github
4. Open a PR to `production`

A lead dev will review and merge.
