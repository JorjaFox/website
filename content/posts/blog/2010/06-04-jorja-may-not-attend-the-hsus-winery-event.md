I don't know for sure (and yes, I dropped a line to ask about it), but the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/ca-winery-event">humanesociety.org page for the event</a> no longer lists Jorja.

Still, this Saturday, June 5, 2010 there will be an Intimate Evening at the Jordan Vineyard & Winery, benefiting The Humane Society of the United States' Making History! Campaigns.  This is for a good cause, so Jorja or not, if you've donated or if you're going, you're helping the world even just a little!
