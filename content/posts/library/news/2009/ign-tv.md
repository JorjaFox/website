**Sara returns to a team in transition.**

[...]

Sorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they've opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She's badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris. It was somewhat surprising considering we never got to see them get married. No wedding photos were offered for show-and-tell. I'm hoping for a wedding flashback in a future episode.

"CSI**s season openers are never this packed with action and character developments. It's generally same ol', same ol'. It made for a very interesting night, even if I did find a few faults with the way things developed. With the dismissal of Riley, the promotions of Langston and Nick, and Sara Sidle's recurring guest spots, "CSI" seems to have everything in order to start the season off on a positive note.
