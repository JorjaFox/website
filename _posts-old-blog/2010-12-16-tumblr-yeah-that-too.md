<a href="http://jorjafoxonline.tumblr.com/"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/12/jfo-tumblrs-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="jfo-tumblrs" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2812" /></a> <a href="http://jorjafoxonline.tumblr.com/">http://jorjafoxonline.tumblr.com/</a> is up and running.

It has few goals.

1) Post funny pictures and let you guys caption them.
2) Let you guys find funny pictures and submit them (which I then approve and post)
3) Laugh

That's really it!  The goal is for entertainment, not to be taken seriously in any way, shape or form.

If you happen to be a Tumblr expert and have suggestions, let me have 'em! I set up IntenseDebate for comments (because a friend of mine works there and suggested it - I'm easy!) and I'm slowly getting that I have to 'friend' people to let them comment so I'm friending everyone), but I _think_ I got it working so anyone can submit content... If you have a Tumblr of course.

Enjoy!
