I will update this post with screencaps and recaps shortly after the episode airs on the East Coast US.</del>  Well ... I WOULD post except CBS is a damn dirty liar, and either Sara's scenes were cut, or they told me lies when I asked if Sara/Jorja was in this episode ... and their press release was wrong.  Bastiches.

<strong>Official Release</strong>
The CSIs discover that two seemingly unrelated crimes are actually part of a revenge plot.

Nothing Jorja specific. If you know something, post a comment!

<strong>Post Airing</strong>
Sara was not in the episode.  She was in Parumph, working a quintuple homicide.  Boo!
