EPK stands for "Electronic Press Kit" and since it's almost 2014, I don't know why we need to specify "electronic" anymore, so I'm calling it what it is. A behind the scenes look into CSI's 300th episode. Jorja is, of course, full of win.

Oh man. I got the sniffles just watching _that_, mostly because of the music.

Oh and you know, you_ know_ I didn't forget you guys outside the US.

I got your back. No screencaps of the episode part, you'll get all that when it really airs, and if you can't see the embedded video, click on my video link and you'll see it there.
