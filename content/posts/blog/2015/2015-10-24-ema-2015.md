Tonight Jorja's at the 2015 <a href="http://www.green4ema.org/">Environmental Media Association</a> Awards.

The Environmental Media Association believes that through television, film and music, the entertainment community has the power to influence the environmental awareness of millions of people.

I have to say, having run this site for as long as I have, I think they're right.
