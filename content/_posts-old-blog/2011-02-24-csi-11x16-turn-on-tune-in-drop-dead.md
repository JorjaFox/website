<h3>Recap</h3>
<del datetime="2011-02-25T03:09:53+00:00"><em>Coming Soon!</em></del>

Wow. Not a great episode, sort of decent with amusing moments, lots of one liners, and Sara's mom taking her to see <em>Altered States</em> (a movie I will not watch at night or with lights off ... I'm a coward about movies like that, though).  It wasn't the best mystery, but it was a trip.  Yes, did that on purpose.
