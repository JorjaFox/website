**Jorja Fox**, the *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* star who was fired for skipping work in a salary dispute, is returning to the hit CBS drama at her old $100,000-per-episode salary.

Fox reached an agreement with the network and will be back on the set next week, the Associated Press reports.

Apparently, Fox did a better job cleaning CBS chief **Leslie Moonves' **floors with her toothbrush than did fellow *CSI *firee **George Eads**. At last report, Eads, who's spent much of the past week apologizing for "oversleeping" to anyone with a microphone, was still out of a job, although TV Guide Online reports that he probably will be rehired.
