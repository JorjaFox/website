The Obama campaign is going to do wonders for the gang running Artists & Athletes, the nonprofit that has found its niche within the confines of Hollywood's interest in and naivet√© about Washington.

Last night the ballroom at the Four Seasons in L.A. was filled with 140 agents, publicists, managers, writers, producers, directors and actors who filed in to listen to Mark Halperin moderate a panel discussion about what to expect from Washington.

Panelists such as CNN/radio personality Roland Martin and GOP media strategist Fred Davis showed off their know-how and answered questions from the audience, including A&A co-chairmen Jason Alexander and Kelsey Grammer, along with Jorja Fox ("CSI"); Isaiah Washington, KaDee Strickland ("Private Practice"), Tom "Owner of the BoSox" Warner, Robert Knepper ("Prison Break"), Robbie Jones ("One Tree Hill"), Francis Fisher (the mom from "Titanic"), Scott Wolfe, Alicia Witt and Joel McHale.

What is that? Pseudo-celebrities wanting to learn about politics all in the same room and Terry McAuliffe is no where to be found?? Boggles the mind.

Rumor has it Halperin was so popular people kept asking questions 40 minutes after it all had concluded.

"There's a new group in town, and Hollywood is excited to learn about it," says a happy Steve Ross, A&A's executive director.

Here are some [web.beimages.net/link/11thltsllnc13/ images] from the event. (Oh look is Scott Wolfe and his "Real World" wife!)
