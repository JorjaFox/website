**Jorja on our minds**

That **Jorja Fox** is one feisty "CSI." No wonder Grissom loves her.

According to the "Star" and the "New York Post", Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit CBS show, was supposed to bite the Las Vegas desert dust in this season's sweeps finale, but she's refused to show up for work to shoot her death scene.

"Her contract is up and they are in conversations," said a CBS spokeswoman.

In 2004, Fox and co-star **George Eads** had a contract dispute and were fired by CBS, then re-hired a few days later.

She reportedly now makes $100,000-per-episode and wants a raise.

The CBS spokeswoman added that Fox did finally appear on set to shoot her scene but instead of being crushed by a car, her demise is a bit "open ended."

Ah, if that could only be true for all of us.
