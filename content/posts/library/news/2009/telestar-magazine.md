"I love the idea of returning as an "invitee" to *CSI*"

In the United States, she has just returned to the series. Between Jorja Fox and *CSI*, it's somewhat *I love you ... me neither*. The 41-year-old actress who plays Sara Sidle welcomes the return to her uniform. Even if her character has changed, including a marriage!

**TELE STAR: You posed with Marg Helgenberger for some sexy photos. Isn't it time that the heroines of *CSI* are just as glamorous?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja Fox:</strong> I hope that we have been in the past! (She laughs.) But the content requires otherwise. They are usually in jeans and waterproof shoes than an evening gown. And all this is not flattering. I can tell you it's not right!

**Do you regret not being able to play the glamor card?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">J.F.:</strong> No. Femininity is primarily a state of the spirit. Anyway, now that Sara, my character is married, she is not supposed to flirt ... (She smiles.)

**When Sara returned to *CSI*, we learned she was married to Grissom. But how do you, since in the United States is no longer seen?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">J.F.:</strong> Right now, this doesn't make problems. Sara has decided to return to help the team. Anyway, she never wanted to be a homemaker. She has never hidden her desire for independence ...

**Will you see William Petersen from time to time?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">J.F.:</strong> Yes, there are still a few weeks, in Los Angeles. When we decided to leave the series, I told him that I wanted to leave first, because I did not want to play [Sara] without him.

**So why did you come back?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">J.F.:</strong> The proposal the producers made was interesting. I just wanted to have a deadline, because I was involved in other projects. I love the idea of returning to the series as an invitee!

**You are very secretive about your private life. Do you have enough time to think about love?**

<strong style="color: #339999;">J.F.:</strong> Sure! (She laughs.) I love being in love. This is my problem, I have a hard time and my family points it out often enough to me ...
