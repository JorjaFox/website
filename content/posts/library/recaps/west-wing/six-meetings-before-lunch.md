**C.J.:** Could you describe what, if any, contact Zoey might have had with David Arbor last night?\
**Gina:** No. I'm sorry.\
**C.J.:** I don't understand. Gina, I'm the press secretary. There's a story that Zoey's involved with, and I need you to tell me what you know about last night.\
**Gina:** I'm sorry, C.J. I can't protect her if she feels she has to do things behind my back. I'm not permitted to discuss the behavior of the protectee.\
**C.J.:** Okay, thanks. (starts to leave.)\
**Gina:** (sits at her desk) Are you sure you don't want to stay and have some coffee? I'm going to stay and look through an FBI photo album of teenage Nazis.\
**C.J.:** Why?\
**Gina:** I'm on a break.\
**C.J.:** See you later.
