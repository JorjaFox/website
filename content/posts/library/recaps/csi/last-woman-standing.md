## Synopsis

Peter Coe, a professional poker player, lost big in the Palermo Poker Classic (PPC) before dying from having his neck cut open in the elevator of his hotel. The only problem? He was in the elevator alone. His friend (and virtual niece) Eva Rendell, the only woman left in the PPC, was at the hotel with Coe, but left before he got on the elevator. David Hodges solves the locked room mystery by determining the killer threw a playing card (the Ace of Spades) to slice Coe's throat as the doors closed. The card was part of a special set of cards made by the Palemro for the 1997 Classic that Coe won.

Trent Aldridge is found dead in a hotel, tied up spread eagle, and died by asphyxiation, choking on some food. While Aldridge checked in alone, he had clearly been up to some sexual shenanigans, and one the hotel staff was tipped by his partner with a poker chip. Seven raw chicken hearts (seven of hearts) were forced fed to Aldridge while tied up. In addition, Aldridge held a high-stakes poker game every week and played against Coe in 1997.

Chicken blood was also found on the playing card used to kill Coe. The coincidences send the CSIs to look at old cases, where they find Ed Ficelli, a pit boss of the Palermo, who OD'd two months prior. The heroin in his system had been poisoned, and the pattern of injections form a perfect match for a Four of Clubs. The prints on the poker chip that Aldridge's dominatrix gave as a tip match Eva Rendell. When they go to find Rendell, she's been beheaded in her hotel room by a medieval war hammer aka a poleaxe (King of Diamonds).

Bo Madison was the third player in 1997, when they were dealt the 'death' hand: Ace of Spades, seven of hearts, four of clubs, King of Diamonds, and King of Spades. Madison has been dead for years, of suicide, so Greg watches the tape of the final match over and over until he determines that Aldrige and Coe were colluding with the dealer to beat Madison. The dealer was Eva Rendell's father, and also died years prior. Ficelli was the ringleader of the scam.

All of this ties back to magician, Dr. Jimmy, who loaned Coe $4000 to get into the PPC, is an expert at throwing cards, had a poleaxe, and skipped town shortly after being held on obstruction of justice. Jimmy had funded the scammers, and was in turn nearly killed by Bo Madison's daughter: His lovely assistant, Kathy Hill. Morgan Brody ends up shooting Kathy when attacked.
