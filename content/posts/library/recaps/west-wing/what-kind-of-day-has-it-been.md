## Summary

The president prepares for a town-hall meeting with college students, while the military searches for a downed pilot in the Iraqi desert.

The staff deals with an American pilot who was shot down in Iraq; Toby's brother is in danger on a space shuttle whose doors won't close; Bartlet and the senior staff walk into a hail of bullets as they leave a town meeting.
