The recipient of this year's Gandhi Award, Jorja Fox never forgets those of us who've done something too: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/personal/jorja/advocacy/2008-animalacres.jpg">Jorja's thank you to JFO for her birthday present</a>

From Animal Acres:

<blockquote>We have all heard the expression "STAR POWER", but actress and animal advocate Jorja Fox, has given that phrase new meaning.<br /><br />As a leading actress on West Win, ER, and most recently, CSI, Jorja Fox used her celebrity status to educate millions of viewers about animal abuse - both by working with producers and writers to air animal issues and video on episodes, and convincing the show to make her character a vegetarian.  Her audience is in the millions - and thanks to Jorja - millions of people have been educated about the cruelties of canned hunting, dog fighting, and food animal slaughter.<br /><br />Jorja was one of Animal Acres first celebrity supporters, lending her voice and participation for our ''Thankful Turkey Celebration'' in 2005.  In addition to addressing the audience about her personal commitment to vegetarianism, Jorja jumped right into farm chores, helping feed the turkeys and giving bottles to rescued piglets.  Jorja has always rolled up her sleeves on other "farm chore days" too, and she is always willing to do whatever is needed around the farm, from mucking barns to cleaning pigs' ears!<br /><br />Last year, we were honored to have Jorja serve as our 2007 Gala Chair, where she played a vital role is helping us raise over $100,000 for farmed animal rescue and humane enforcement efforts.<br /><br />It is hard to find the words to thank Jorja for being such a dedicated friend of Animal Acres, so we gave her our highest honor -- we named a farmed animal after her!  We are also honored to give Jorja this year's GANDHI AWARD for her outstanding commitment to providing rescue, sanctuary, and hope for farmed animals.</blockquote>
