From the Sidney Herald: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/you-dont-win-friends-with-saladtvs-best-and-worst-vegetarians-20150921-gjpo0b.html">'You don't win friends with salad':TV's best (and worst) vegetarians</a>
<blockquote>**Sara Sidle â€“ <em>CSI </em>**Forensic scientist Sara Sidle makes a living being up-close and personal with dead bodies, but she draws the line when it comes to animals. Sarah wasn't always a vegetarian, instead she became one halfway through the show after spending a night with a dead, decomposing pig. Remarkably, Sara wasn't the first vegetarian character played by actress Jorja Fox, who also gave up meat for Dr Maggie Doyle on <em>E.R.</em></blockquote>
A correction for them. Doyle gave up meat because of Jorja. She was supposed to practice one-handed sutures on a pig's foot and Jorja didn't want to. Boom. Eggplants.

And yes, they said Sarah.
