It's Wednesday, and our favorite (hah) gossip monger is back.  This time it's something vaguely promising, a little spoilerish (though frankly we already know this from the promos) and a bit squee-worthy.

<blockquote><b>Question: So, you are one of the lucky privileged people who got to see the premiere of <i>CSI</i> early.  What is the deal with Grissom-Sara? All of these interviews and articles make it sound like their relationship is in huge amounts of trouble. -- Sarah</b>
<b>Ausiello:</b> I didn't see any signs of trouble in the first episode, but the hour isn't really about them; it's about Warrick. If anything, the one significant scene they <i>do</i> share in the Oct. 9 opener is rather moving and, dare I say, hopeful.</blockquote>
