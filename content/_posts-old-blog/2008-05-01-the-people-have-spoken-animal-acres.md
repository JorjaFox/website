The people have spoken.  All funds raised between now and July 1st 2008 will be donated to ...

<a href="http://www.animalacres.org"></a>

This means we have an official goal of <b>$1000</b> dollars.

As we get closer, we'll figure out what area of the charity to donate too. With $1000 we can get Jorja's name in the Gandhi Society, but with $2100, we can adopt a cow, pig, sheep, goat, turkey AND chicken for a year. We'll see where it goes.
