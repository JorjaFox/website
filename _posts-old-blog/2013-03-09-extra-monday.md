<blockquote>We're interviewing “CSI” stars Ted Danson, Jorja Fox and George Eads on Monday. What should we ask them? Leave your question in the comments, and it could be answered on "Extra"!</blockquote>
If you have a question for them, you can post it on Facebook (yes, this time you **do** need Facebook to leave a question) at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151383926119755&amp;set=a.172852769754.122327.26676834754&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1">Extra's Page for Ted, Jorja and George</a>**
**

Don't have Facebook? Post it here and maybe one of us will ask for you.

The video will likely be posted on <a href="http://www.extratv.com/">extraTV.com</a>
