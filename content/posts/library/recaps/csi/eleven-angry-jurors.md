## Synopsis

The lone holdout on a jury is found dead in the jury room. The eleven jurors who were voting guilty and who hated the dead juror are the natural suspects. Nick reopens a four year old case when the sister of the victim comes forward with new evidence.

## Review

Sara is fairly nondescript in this -- a good, general workman-like job with nothing standing out. She works with Warrick and Grissom on the jury case -- she is the one that finds the peanut butter in the victim's chili, and later she discovers the carcass of the 'killer' bee.

## Notes

* Again Sara shows that she'll always laugh at Grissom's jokes.

## Quotes

**Warrick:** Take me out to the ballgame.\
**Sara:** Buy me some peanuts.

**Sara:** The killer, I presume. _(holding up dead bee)_
