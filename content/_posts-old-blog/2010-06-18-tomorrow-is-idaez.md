The intent is to send the message: <strong>Elephants don't belong in zoos.</strong> 

If there's no place near you to protest at, consider a <a href="http://www.idablog.org/featured/international-day-of-action-for-elephants-in-zoos-join-ida%E2%80%99s-virtual-demonstration-on-saturday/">virtual demonstration</a>.
