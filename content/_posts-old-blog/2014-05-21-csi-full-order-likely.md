This came up when <a title="CSI Moves to Sunday" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/csi-moves-to-sunday/">the new schedule was announced</a>, and we were told <em>CSI</em> will air on Sunday and <strong>then</strong> <em>CSI: Cybe</em>r takes it's spot. At the time, I speculated <em>CSI</em> would air all 22 eps, and CBS said that they'd air 'straight through.' This was brought up again on <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/Ask-Matt-Cancellations-Louie-Person-Interest-Blacklist-Castle-Finale-1082023.aspx">TV Guide's Ask Matt</a>:
<blockquote><strong>Question:</strong> I'm a big fan of Patricia Arquette and am anxiously awaiting her new <em>CSI: Cyber</em> series. I was disappointed to read that <em>CSI: Cyber</em> won't begin until all the original <em>CSI</em> episodes have aired in its new Sunday time slot. Does that mean <em>Cyber</em> won't start until May, or will the original <em>CSI</em> have a shortened season? — Victoria

<strong>Matt Roush:</strong> The idea as I understand it is to run <em>CSI</em>'s 15th season straight through until early spring with no repeats, and that would most likely be a full-season order of 22, which means <em>Cyber</em> would probably get the short order of its initial 13-episode pickup without a back-nine — the spring tryout (probably starting in March or thereabouts) presumably leading to a full-season order for year two if all goes well.</blockquote>
So to translate a little... <em>CSI</em> starts filming abnormally early this year. In fact, they start next month! Normally they don't start until around July. In part, this is because production of <em>CSI</em> is a lot of post-processing work (the TMI graphics for example and the dead bodies). When you consider what <em>Cybe</em>r's doing, they also need more time.

Well for one, y'all can stop freaking out about <em>CSI</em> getting a short season. the show is doing well enough, and it was moved to Sunday in part because it's proven to be stable with regards to moves. People will follow it. In addition, it's a surprisingly <em>bad</em> pairing with crime dramas! When <em>CSI</em> was at it's best, it followed <em>Survivor</em>. Once they moved that, <em>CSI</em>s ratings dropped, which implies that people who watch <em>CSI</em> aren't generally crime show aficionados as much as all that. I think that a <em>CSI</em>/<em>Elementary</em> pairing would be different, as the latter is a drama with crime (vs a crime with drama), but <em>Elementary</em> is also low a little low.

And we're into major speculation land here, but I think a Sunday move is a good thing for <em>CSI</em>'s long term sustainability. <em>The Good Wife</em> has proven that Sunday is not a barren landscape, and I think the smarter dramas (no offense to <em>Criminal Minds</em> but it's not 'thinking' so much as crime in my eyes, like <em>Law &amp; Order</em>) will be a better lead in.

Bonus guess? CBS will move <em>Survivor</em> to Sunday, before <em>The Good Wife</em> and <em>CSI</em> mid-season, when the <em>Madame Secretary</em> bombs totally. Oh yes, that's my pick for first death. After all, <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/21/survivor-cagayan-28-seasons/"><em>Survivor</em> is one of those things that goes forever</a>.
