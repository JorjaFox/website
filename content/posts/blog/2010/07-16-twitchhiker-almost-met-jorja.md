I don't know how to explain this, except Paul Smith managed to use Twitter to travel the globe.  Along the way he met many celebs. Including Jorja Fox.  Well... Sort of.

<blockquote>At another Hollywood party, I recognised Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle in CSI. Buoyed by my earlier success with Liv Tyler, and fortified by several beers, I loitered with intent, waiting for the right time to introduce myself.

It is possible that I appeared to be a wild-eyed, leering madman. Apparently sensing that I was standing a little too close to be innocently passing by, Jorja stood up and, well . . . ran away from me.

The only positive thing to come out of this encounter is that the police were never called.</blockquote>
