<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4675" title="CBS Watch" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/05/cbswatch.2012.05-210x140.jpg" alt="CBS Watch" width="100" height="75" />It has little to do with anything other than an up-sell of expensive spa treatments which most of us will never afford, however, the latest <a href="http://cbswatchmagazine.com/">CBS Watch Magazine</a> issue tossed out a cute CSI/Jorja suggestion:
<blockquote>Willow Stream Spa • Sonoma, Calif.

SPAS ARE RELAXING, but ones in the middle of wine country offer a double dose of destressing. **Willow Stream Spa** is part of the 13-acre Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa, and is one of the few in the nation that feature natural thermal mineral waters. (They flow a little more than 1,100 feet beneath the inn at 135 degrees!) This oasis pays homage to Americans Indians with its "healing through water" philosophy, but also includes yoga and guided hikes and bike tours. **<a href="http://fairmont.com/sonoma">http://fairmont.com/sonoma</a>**

**COOLEST TREATMENT:** Vanilla Float, $159. A heated flotation table, which makes you feel weightless, would be the perfect relaxation prescription for _CSI's_ Sara Sidle (**Jorja Fox**). After a foot soak and body exfoliation, you're enveloped in a vanilla and shea butter wrap that helps improve circulation, which is followed by a face and scalp massage. At the end, a sweet treat awaits you: a vanilla float from the spa's cafe.</blockquote>
Mmm. Vanilla floats. It's in the 90s here, I think I may get one. The issue is the one with _NCIS: LA_'s Daniela Ruah on the cover.

You'd think they'd mention that Jorja's birthday is little more than a month away! You _did_ donate for her <a href="http://crowdrise.com/jfo-bday2012/">birthday fundraiser</a>? Right? Riiiiight?
