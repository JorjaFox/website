CBS has updated their description of CSI
<blockquote><em>CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</em> is a fast-paced drama about a team of forensic investigators trained to solve crimes by examining the evidence. They are on the case 24/7, scouring the scene, collecting the irrefutable evidence and finding the missing pieces that will solve the mystery.  <strong>D.B. Russell</strong>, the new CSI Supervisor for the grave shift, comes to the team after heading the Seattle Crime Lab. He's a family man and scientist, but not a nerd. Son of hippie parents, he's a "Left Coast" Sherlock Holmes who devours crime novels and looks at every crime scene as if it were a story waiting to be told. Other CSI members include <strong>Catherine Willows</strong>, the team's former supervisor and an investigator with a cop's instinct for reading human behavior; <strong>Nick Stokes</strong>, the conscience of the team, often driven by his emotional connection to the victim to always get the job done; <strong>Sara Sidle</strong>, aka Mrs. Grissom, the moral compass of the team who is relentless in her pursuit of criminals; <strong>Greg Sanders</strong>, once an off-beat tech analyst and now an experienced and intuitive crime solver; and <strong>Morgan Brody</strong>, an exile from the Los Angeles Crime Lab and the daughter of Undersheriff Ecklie. She's a natural born investigator who still has a lot to learn about politics and family. The CSI team members also work closely with <strong>Captain Jim Brass</strong>, a seasoned detective and protector of CSI, sometimes to a fault; <strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>, the ever-professional medical examiner; his wise-cracking assistant, <strong>David Phillips</strong>; and <strong>David Hodges</strong>, a tech of many talents who often rubs people the wrong way, but never fails to deliver.

<em>CSI</em> begins its 12th season on Wednesday, September 21, 2011

ON AIR: Wednesdays (10:00-11:00PM, ET/PT)

Is it just me or does that make "DB" sound a bit like Sara?  Hippies, left coast... Nah.  I'm sure that his parents weren't abusive/a murderer.  I'm really delighted they flagged Sara as the "Moral Compass" of the team.  Seems appropriate.
