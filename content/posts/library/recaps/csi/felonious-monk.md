## Synopsis

The CSI investigate the disturbing case of the execution-style slaying of four Buddhist Monks, found shot point blank while chanting in their monastery near Las Vegas. Tensions in the neighborhood bring obvious suspects into the picture. Gil and Nick investigate the owners of a butcher shop who appear to resent the diversity the temple brought to their neighborhood. The culprit is someone less obvious, though and with the murder weapon is left in plain sight begging the question: is the killer an insider? Catherine meets with her old mentor Jimmy to discuss the cold case of her murdered best friend, a fellow stripper at Catherine's old club, and Catherine feels responsible for having deserted her. With new DNA evidence available, Catherine decides to revisit the murder case -- a crime that has haunted her through the years, after the man convicted of the crime claims he's innocent shortly before he dies.
