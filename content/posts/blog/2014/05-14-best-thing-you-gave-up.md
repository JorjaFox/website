<span style="color: #000000;">Sweden With Love (aka "<a title="Jorja Fox: The Wild Side" href="https://jorjafox.net/2013/jorja-fox-the-wild-side/">The site with the best Jorja interview in the known universe</a>") had _one more_ little thing to ask Jorja. What was the best thing she ever gave up.</span>

The answer may surprise you!
<blockquote><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10817" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/05/jpeg-183x250.jpg" alt="What's The Best Thing You Ever Gave Up? - Sweden With Love" width="183" height="250" />**Actress Jorja Fox:** “Since my early 20s, I’ve felt I had to wear heels when I get dressed up. You want to look great and you want to be like everyone else, you know? But now that I’m in my 40s, I’ve noticed I care a lot less what people think about me. And when you’re 5’9” and you wear heels, you’re towering over almost every woman in the room and half the men. It’s always been a little uncomfortable and not that fun. So I’ve given it up! I don’t feel guilty about showing up at a party or an event in flats anymore. I’m more comfortable and I still feel beautiful. So nowadays, I’m the one looking for cool flats when I’m looking at dress shoes. And I don’t miss the high heels at all!”

_Emmy Award-winning actress <a href="http://www.jorjafox.com/">Jorja Fox</a> stars on CBS’s hit show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_.</blockquote>
Heels. I never got the hang of them, myself.

Props to Lanos for finding the article!
