**FD:** What a lame way to get Sara off the show. No way would she have done that if she was a real person.

**Stan Givens:** I loved the Sara Sidle on CSI; I'd get rid of Eckley.

[...]

**bklyntransplant:** Jonathan, Too bad there's no one cute and perky on CSI - You'd remember her name!

**Ellen:** Funny, I'm from Brooklyn, too, and I was about to say the same thing.

**Jonathan:** Oh, you mean Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox? Now she's \*not there\* and I'm pissed!

**Ellen:** Was Sara ever perky? She always seemed depressed to me.

Dan S.: JORJA FOX was the main reason I watched CSI! Can't stand Marg Hellenberger; she should have been the one to go.

Jonathan: Marg is fine, but I loved Jorja too. I'm having a hard time typing through my tears now she's gone.

Ellen: In fairness, I think Jorja went on her own, didn't she? Marg didn't volunteer.
