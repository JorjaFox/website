My wife and I were chatting about how people name things terribly and she pointed out that for someone who hates redundancy as much as I do (don't say ATM Machine to me), I named a website "Jorja Fox: Online."

Now. In my defense, in was 1995 and the original name was "Ipstenu's Jorja Fox Online Fan Site." It was less obvious that things were online-only. Rather quickly, everyone started calling it "Jorja Fox Online" so I slapped the colon in there and the site has been "Jorja Fox: Online" ever since.

But boy howdy is that redundant.

So here's my challenge for you! What should I 'rebrand' JFO as? Your parameters are as follows:
<ol>
	<li>The initials must remain JFO</li>
	<li>It shouldn't be vulgar or offensive</li>
</ol>
That's it!
