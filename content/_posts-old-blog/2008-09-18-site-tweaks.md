Short version:  Updated RSS Feed with email capability and <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2.2.6_released">Gallery 2.2.6 updated</a>.

<!--more-->
Long version: Now that we're on the new box and all is well, we've fiddled with the blog.  You don't need to go to the blog folder to view pages, which is a sneaky thing that accidentally caused the RSS feed to recache everything. Didn't realize that would happen, my bad.

Speaking of RSS, Google bought out FeedBurner, and while the old RSS feed is still working, you may want to switch to the new one, which also allows for email updates. If you like your updates old-school (remember the days of email updates from JFO?) that is.

Finally the rampant string of server upgrades is because there was rampant string of security bugs that had to be fixed.  PHP holes, SQL flaws, and Flash exploits are all the rage.  Not to mention the DNS Cache poisoning brouhahah.  We should be fine, but I'm keeping up with the news to make sure we are.
