God bless Twitter.  <a href="http://twitter.com/marleematlin">@MarleeMatlin</a> tweeted that she'll be on "CSI".  Her episode airs February 3rd, which means that's got to be "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" ... Which means she's most likely playing Grissom's ex.  She said she's filming with Phyllis Freilich, who was born in 1944, so it's most likely she's Grissom's mother (Billy was born in 1953, so she's ... older).

Now please note, I could be wrong about this, but logically they just cast two deaf actresses (two of the best known deaf actresses in the bloody world, by the way, next to Linda the Librarian from <em>Sesame Street</em>) for an 'unnamed' episode.  Due to air in February.  And we know that there are at least two deaf actresses needed for an episode about Grissom's deaf mother.  So I think we're pretty safe here in saying Marlee will play Grissom's ex.

Here are her tweets. Read them from the bottom up:

Happy Hannukah to me, apparently, from the SWDJB, as I was wishing she could possibly be cast as the ex.
