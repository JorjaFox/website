I only knew becuase the ADI folks mentioned they were filming it right then!  The show re-aired at 3am, so I used my clever DVR skills and now we have screencaps and a transcript!  Okay, CNN made the transcript.

&bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Issues_with_Jane_Velez-Mitchell_(23_February_2011)">Transcript</a>
&bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/talkshow/20110223-issues/">Screencaps</a>

The video is large.  100megs.  So I'm going to see about splitting some of it out and posting it.  Usually they put at least one clip up on Jane's site, so remember to check out CNN's Issues with Jane page.

Oh look! Here it is!

Oh and don't forget that we are STILL raising money to keep these lions happy! It costs $8000 to feed a lion for a year, which is a lot more than feeding my two cats costs!  Donate at <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/lionark/fundraiser/jorjafoxonline">Crowdrise: LionArk Fundraiser</a> and make some happy big cats!  As Jorja says, the proof of our own humanity is NOT in how we treat each other, but how we treat non-humans.
