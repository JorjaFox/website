But as we can tell, Jorja is. I wasn't sure if they recast Warrick's wife, but I would suspect so, and since no one really remembers her anyway...

This is probably as close to a CSI/Doctor Who crossover (or Jorja on Doctor Who) as I'll ever get. Weeping Angels. Heh. That's funny to like 7 of you isn't it?
