CSI star Jorja Fox is tired of looking like a dowdy stiff. She thinks her lab-tech character Sara should be able to show as much skin as the cadavers in the Las Vegas morgue. What prompted this sudden change? The single star was horrified when she began getting calls from pals asking if she was pregnant - because she looks so heavy on TV in lab coats and baggy shirts.

She immediately had her handlers place a call to the show's honchos demanding that next season she get a makeover so she can show off her stuff. A pal tells Star that after three years of hiding under lab coats as Dr. Doyle on ER and another three years on CSI, foxy Jorja is itching to slip into some belly-baring outfits like her competing CSI:Miami beauty Emily Proctor gets to wear.
