Massive props to Margamania for the clip.  The press kit is basically a way to pimp CSI to various markets. They used to just put up pictures, but back in 1999, CBS put out DVDs with all their shows. This is the latest in the line of selling CSI, at the venerable age of 10.

Jorja's still a mite fascinated by LOST, but alas, it's pretty much done filming, so I doubt she'll get her wish of being on the show.

</ul>

The full video is rather long (11 minutes) and I'm not going to post the whole thing.  But if you ever wondered if Jorja loves the fans, yes.  She does.

Updated: Okay I didn't post the video on JFO.  I did it on YouTube.
