I really like an interview that starts with the disclaimer that Jorja's not typical:
<blockquote><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11519" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/11/jorja-fox-1-233x250.jpg" alt="jorja-fox-1" width="233" height="250" />Catch up with the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation star, find out her favorite places in Los Angeles and more.

Disclaimer: Jorja Fox’s is not a typical success story. The <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn’t in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt. Today, Fox is diving back into a 15th season on <em>CSI</em> as forensic scientist Sara Sidle, and sharing with us her favorite L.A. spots. Listen in.</blockquote>
