<h2>Review</h2>

Well, it's an episode that didn't make golf any more or less interesting to me, but there were a few, select, Sara scenes, and a tiny tidbit of Grissom.  So three stars (out of five) and an amusing hour.

<blockquote>**Sanders:** Sometimes I wonder if you two are really married.
**Sidle:** Well ... Now that you mention it ... Just kidding!
**Sanders:** Hah. 6000 miles?
**Sidle:** _*grinning*_ So far, so good.
