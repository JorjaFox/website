The amazing sidlechick87 is running her last fundraiser and we're going to make it a doozy! Jorja's 'out of town' this year in July (her birthday month) so the plan is to have donations extend through Mid-September.  The first step will be, of course, to pick a charity!  So let's join in and give Jorja a great birthday gift, thanking her for CSI, ER and the upcoming Drop Dead Diva.  After all, we're her fans! That's what we do best. Fan.
