I'm starting to think @waldeckvision really likes me... Here are some photos from Frank Waldeck. <del>One is</del>Â Two are clearly from the currently being filmed episode, which should be #21 "Dune and Gloom" (and everyone seems to think it's Jorja). The other two are a mystery! Ooooooo! I believe they're from #21 as well, but I'm not sure.
