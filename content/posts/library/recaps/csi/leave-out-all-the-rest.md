## Quotes

**Sara:** Hello from below the Equator, from Porto Ayrota. We've been at sea over a month now, and you wouldn't believe the crew. Students, activists, scientists ... the dinner conversations alone are mind blowing. There's even this Marine Biologist that reminds me a little bit of you. I wish that we could talk in person, but, uh, this is the best that I can do. I want to apologize for being out of touch. I have been thinking about us a lot, though. All the moments. I thought we could survive anything. This trip has given me a lot of clarity. That last year in Vegas, I could barely breath, let alone think. But, um, now, for the first time in a really long time, I'm happy.

**Sara:** Before I left, um, you said some things that I tried not to hear. But now I, uh, I think you were right. If a relationship can't move forward, it withers. I've been waiting for you to decide, but sometimes not making a decision is making a decision.

**Sara:** Anyway. What I'm trying to say it ... you don't have to worry about me any more. I'm good. I'm really good. And honestly? I think it's better this way.
