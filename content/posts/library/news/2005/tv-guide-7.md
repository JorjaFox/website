***CSI* PUTS SEX SCENE TO BED**

It's not often that *CSI* mixes business with pleasure, so when exec producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed in the September 25th issue of TV GUIDE that Grissom (**William Petersen**) and Sara (**Jorja Fox**) would "spend the night together" while out of town working on a possible quadruple-murder case, fans took notice. They also took notice when the episode aired on October 20, and there were three body bags but no naked bodies. In fact, there was very little Grissom, naked or otherwise. What gives? "Billy had a death in the family, and the script was rewritten to accommodate his absence," Mendelsohn explains. "The stay tuned to see if the story line reemerges in a future episode." Oh, Carol. Ya big tease.
