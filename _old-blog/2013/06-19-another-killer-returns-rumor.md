_ETA: I still don't know ScreenSpy, but their report remains unconfirmed until someone from a casting agency, CSI or CBS steps up and says something._

I don't know ScreenSpy from Adam, but this was fairly interesting. Keep in mind, I consider this to be _unconfirmed_ right now. There's no official word about this at all, to the point that CBS doesn't seem to know a blessed thing. But hey, this is TV folks. Who knows anymore!

<blockquote>
<h3>Adam Harrington</h3>
[caption id="attachment_7395" align="alignleft" width="209"]<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/06/adamharrington.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7395" alt="Adam Harrington as Ronald Basderic" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/06/adamharrington-209x250.png" width="209" height="250" /></a> Adam Harrington as Ronald Basderic[/caption]

Earlier this year Adam guested on a _CSI_ episode entitled “Code Blue Plate Special” as an obsessive stalker who becomes the chief suspect in a case involving multiple homicides. Fans responded to his very unique character Ronald Basderic to the extent that a second episode “Forget Me Not” focusing on Basderic’s new obsession with seeking revenge on Jorja Fox’s Sara Sidle was ordered.This summer, Adam guested on CBS’ _Criminal Minds_, as a dangerous criminal masquerading as a victim. Adam describes the role as a dark and intense experience. _“After being underground in a cell for a week I took off after it was done and just sat on a beach in the sun for a few days,”_ the actor told ScreenSpy recently.

But don’t expect to see Adam resting on his laurels for long. The ever busy _Circle_ alum is currently in talks to resume his role as Basderic next season. It’s not Ethan Conant, but we’re really digging this darker side Adam’s been exploring recently.</blockquote>

So what do you think about the idea of Basderic, who's in _prison_ right now, coming back to haunt Sara? Do you think this whole thing is bunk? Would you like to see him? Do you think this means Laura Sidle would come back too? Oooh! Maybe he'll try to kill Laura!

I ... may be a little crazy.

Again, this is just a rumor. No panic attacks allowed and anyone who reposts this as 'fact' is a silly, silly person.
