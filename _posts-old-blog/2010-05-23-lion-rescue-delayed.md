When you think about it, just going from your house across the country is tricky enough.  Add in multiple nations and it takes longer.  Putting lions into the mix? Oy!

So I'm not hugely shocked that there were logistical issues with the lion rescue, and the press conference set for May 24th (i.e. tomorrow) is postponed.  They had some aircraft loading issues, and airport issues, and right now ADI thinks the arrival will be the middle of next week.
