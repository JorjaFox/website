Jorja Fox aka Sara Sidle:

**SHOOTING STARS OCT. 13, 2005**

It deals with a bunch of kids that end up in a cult, and a spaceship is supposed to come get them. I loved that it had a little bit of mysticism in it. One of the scenes involves this girl who ends up in this abandoned barn. All of a sudden, the whole place starts to turn into white light and the barn starts to shake. And we come to find out it's the police helicopter landing, but there's a minute there where you're thinking, "Oh my god. This spaceship is coming to get this girl."

**A BULLET RUNS THROUGH IT NOV. 10, 2005**

I love the idea of all these different communities and their perception of events that have a little bit to do with how they see the world and what happened. And we have to piece it together just purely through the evidence, which is sort of the bible of our show, not taking any of those opinions to heart, to find out the truth of the situation. And that's so prevalent right now - people jump very quickly to conclusions about all types of things, from politics to their own neighborhoods.
