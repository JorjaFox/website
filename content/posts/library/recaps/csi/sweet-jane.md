## Synopsis

A dentist is a serial killer, and has been murdering women in Las Vegas since the 1970s, leaving three as Jane Does. Complicating the matter, the killers MO has changed over the years, and not all the cases are precisely the same. Doc Robbins connects the dental work between two of the cases, which leads the CSIs to their killer, Dr. Dave. Dr. Dave chooses not to tell the CSI's the names of his victims, claiming that doing so would tarnish his memories. He has no feeling of remorse, and only regrets being caught.

## Review

Sara works the 1999 Jane Doe case, and takes the detective from that case to task for doing a poor investigation.

## Notes

* Sara is a little confrontational with the original investigating detective.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Weak is the best that we have right now.
