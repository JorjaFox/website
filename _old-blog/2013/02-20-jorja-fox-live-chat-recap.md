You knew I was doing this, right? I'm not embedding the replies because, at a certain point, it breaks things. Trust me, this is what happened.

So I'm going to post these in order, with the Question and the Answer in a quote block. I hope it makes sense. And yes, she replied to me and called me M (so she probably recognized me! Yikes!).
