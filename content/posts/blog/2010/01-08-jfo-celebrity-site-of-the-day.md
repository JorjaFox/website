<a href="http://www.csotd.com/"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/01/award.jpg" alt="" title="award" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2177" /></a> Gosh.  I didn't expect that! I did add JFO to <a href="http://www.celebrity-link.com/c72/showcelebrity_categoryid-7234.html">Celebrity Link</a>, but that was mostly to get more people aware that, yes, JFO is here and we have Jorja News!  Sure, I knew that was also a 'nomination' for CSOTD, but honestly, I see JFO as the workhorse of the fansite world. I've never been good at whiz-bang flashy design, or fantastic special features.  I just devoted myself to making a robust information site, where people could see everything that makes Jorja special.

This is, actually, the first 'award' I've ever gotten for JFO!

I'm all <a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=verklempt">verklempt</a>!
