Straight from TV Line, <a href="https://tvline.com/2021/03/31/csi-vegas-reboot-series-order-wallace-langham-hodges/">_CSI_ is coming back</a>, only this time it's _CSI: Vegas_

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">CBS announced today it has given a series order to CSI: VEGAS, the sequel to the Network’s global hit “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” one of the most-watched drama series of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. Original “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox will reprise their roles as Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, respectively. Produced by CBS Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer Television, the new CBS original series will star Paula Newsome, Matt Lauria, Mel Rodriguez and Mandeep Dhillon. Original CSI star Wallace Langham will also return to the series as David Hodges.<cite>Source: <a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=57269">CBS Press Express</a></cite></blockquote>

The new logline is interesting:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Facing an existential threat that could bring down the Crime Lab, a brilliant new team of forensic investigators must welcome back old friends and deploy new techniques to preserve and serve justice in Sin City.</blockquote>

So yes, this is real, and yes, this is happening.

How excited are we?
