The CSIs investigate the murder of a rock and roll groupie and the disappearance of a prostitute that both have ties to a mysterious band, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, March 12 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. KISS lead singer and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Gene Simmons guest stars as himself.
