<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/05/lions-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="lions" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2425" /> Four lions, rescued by Animal Defenders International (ADI) from a Bolivian circus, will be arriving in California on May 25th, and taken to the ARK2000 sanctuary in San Andreas, California.  ARK2000 is run by the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), and is an open habitat for wild animals.  Just recently, Boliva banned circuses from having live animals, and these four lions mark the first to be brought to better living.

Jorja is planned to be on hand for their arrival.
