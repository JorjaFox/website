Despite Lady Heather's rivalry with Sara Sidle over the years, I don't think anyone wanted her to be a true terrorist, and *CSI* obliges. It's a frame job, and when the real terrorist shows up--he's played by frequent baddie Doug Hutchinson--we know immediately where the episode is going. Regardless, it doesn't matter, as this was an episode about bringing together the original team and sending them off in a way that pleased fans who showed up earlier in the show's run as well as the fans who stuck around for the series over the long term.

Although Ted Danson and the new players--minus Elisabeth Shue and George Eads' characters--are players in the new episode, it really is an episode that is about the original characters, many of whom left at some point but came back for the movie. Willows, Grissom and Sidle get the most screentime (there's even a bees-oriented scene!). And when Lady Heather eventually does show up, she helps with the case but also helps the tension between Grissom and Sidle to subside.

Which leads us to the lovely final few minutes of the series, when Grissom tells the bomber that he understands bombs as much as he understands oceans, talking to the criminal about a whale and comparing the whale to the bomber's ultimate love for Lady Heather. Catherine Willows decides to put her 'hat in the ring' for a director's position, and D.B. Russell packed up and got ready to go. While we got closure for many of the main characters, the best moment was when Sara decided to come with him on his boat to try a relationship again.
