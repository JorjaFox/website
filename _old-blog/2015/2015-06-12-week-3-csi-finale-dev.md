There are crickets...

Some of you may have seen the tweets about the set being dismantled:

This is true, but some things are being moved to _CSI: Cyber_ so they'll be able to film the movie. They have to take it down in order to set up the new show for that location. I'm very thankful I got a chance to see the set once.

While Zuiker has been quiet about the filming, when he does talk about _CSI_ he mentions GSR:

Marg was on some CBS talk shows for "The Dome" (which she'll guest on this summer) and said CSI starts filming in July.

Liz Devine mentioned that in the CSI Writers' Room, they have **EP. 1602, end of Act IV** on the board and when she wrote "End of Series" everyone fell silent.

Based on that, I believe they're going to treat it like a two-part episode (so a TV movie) rather than just one super-long episode (think "Lady Heather's Box").
