Twenty years ago, _ER_ debuted on NBC. Which means 18 years ago this winter we had the first single page version of this site. Sorry, I think I'm feeling incredibly old... if this website was a person it would be going to college, which is where it started!

Okay, now that I can breathe again, The Wire has looked at [Fifteen Years at County General: Definitively Ranking the Cast of 'ER'](https://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/09/fifteen-years-at-county-general-definitively-ranking-all-of-ers-doctors-and-nurses/380164/)

22. **[Maggie Doyle (Jorja Fox)](/library/actor/er/**

_(Recurring Seasons 3-5)_ ER should have paid to keep Fox around (she departed for The _West Wing_ and then _CSI_). Appearing before Weaver came out, she was the show's first major gay character (although her orientation was much more obliquely referenced) and just the kind of admirable no-nonsense physician had plenty of in the early seasons. Later years demanded everyone have some kind of crippling personal drama, but Doyle mostly just did her job well.

That makes me totally miss Doyle now, wow. She was great. I still wish we'd gotten that final send off with Doyle vs Romano. In my dreams, the helicopter that killed him was named Doyle...
