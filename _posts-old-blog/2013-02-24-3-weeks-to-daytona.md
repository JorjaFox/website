<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00084.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6643" alt="3 Weeks to Daytona" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00084-250x250.jpg" width="275" height="140" /></a> I've watched all of Jorja's movies, and most of her TV work (I still need to get a copy of "Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunnell Story", and a DVD of her ABC After School Special would be nice). I've seen "The Jerky Boys" and "The Kill-Off", I watched her die in "Happy Hell Night" (and promptly turned the movie off, I don't like horror). I think I'm pretty well versed in Jorja's movies and repertoire at this point.

If you're going to watch a movie that happens to have Jorja in it, the best movie is "Memento," hands down. If you're going to watch a movie just for Jorja, it's a close race between "Food For The Heart" and "Forever Fabulous." Somewhere in between those movies is "3 Weeks to Daytona." While it's predictable and self-explanatory, the movie never dragged and I didn't feel pained for watching the non-Jorja scenes. Quite often, even with CSI, I fast forward through parts without her. Not so this movie, which kept me entertained to the point that I ended up re-watching it when I took screenshots.

On a Jorja Scale, I give it three stars. On a personal scale, this is a great Sunday afternoon movie. It's short, to the point, and the acting is only cheesy when it's supposed to be. Bonus points for Rip Torn (from "Men in Black") and getting to hear Jorja say 'fuck' a lot.
