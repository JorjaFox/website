<img class="alignleft size-slider-nav-thumbnail wp-image-5312" title="Code Blue Plate Special" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/10/vlcsnap-00124-110x70.jpg" alt="Code Blue Plate Special" width="110" height="70" />This is one of those episodes where I give it four stars for Sara and two in general. The plot was straight-forward enough, and I bet most of you knew who the killer was. I think I would have liked it if we had more flashbacks to the patrons than to just Sara/Basderic's interaction, because that could have carried the episode on its own. As it was, this felt like two separate episodes.

On the other hand, that's exactly why I feel this is a great Sara episode. Her half was knocked out of the park. Sara was very shades of "One-Hit Wonder" and "Too Tough To Die" where she chased that rabbit, even if it wasn't the right one. Unlike "Sex, Lies, and Larvae" however, Sara's cool was lost in a very controlled manner. She did snap at Basderic in the end, with an awesome monologue, but she didn't get up in his face to the point that I was wondering where Nick was to haul her off the guy.

In that, I loved seeing the character grow without loosing her core. Sara doesÂ <em>not</em> take it well when women are abused. I wonder if DB or Finn will catch on to that. Certainly Greg has. I can't decide if Nick noticed or not, or if he just accepts Sara for who she is and lets her run with it.

Next week? "Wild Flowers" which will have Sara in the desert again. More flashbacks? Probably not, as it's not a Sara Heavy episode, but we'll see.
