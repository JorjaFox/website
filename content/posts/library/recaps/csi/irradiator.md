The evident suggest Herson is the mysterious 'Dr. Jekyll' serial killer. The more the examine his house, the more the evidence supports their theory, until they find out that Herson is actually the latest *victim*.

After knocking Ray out, Dr. Jekyll remains at large.

## Review

While Sara is back on the job, she still hates the limits of how much they can help. She's on game the whole episode, making connections quickly.

## Notes

* Sara is familiar with the particulars of the Manson Family (they used to break into people's houses and perform 'creepy crawls')
