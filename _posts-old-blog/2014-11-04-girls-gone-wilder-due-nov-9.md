I'm going to preface this with a gif. This is how the rescheduling makes me feel.

You too, huh? The CSIWritersRoom Twitter account has been told that GGW will air Sunday:

The reason for the non-airing was football double headers. Personally I'm a baseball fan myself. At least that generally has the decency to be done before TV season. I root for a team who rarely makes the playoffs.

By now most of you have read The National Report's article that <a href="http://nationalreport.net/cbs-cancels-csi-crime-scene-investigation-will-return-mid-season-break/">CBS Cancels ‘CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'; Will Not Return After Mid-season Break</a>.

They're not correct. There's no mid-season break, never was. _CSI_ was always supposed to air all episodes straight through, and we already talked about why it was <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/short-order-csi-15/">scaled back to 18 episodes</a>.

See? Not true.

Is this the show's last season? It really depends on a couple things. First, how well is the uptick from the recent two ep postponement (which means please watch!) and second, <a title="Pissed About The Scheduling Drama?" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/pissed-scheduling-drama/">do take the time to write in and tell CBS that you want CSI to stick around</a>. And let me stress, that national news site? It's the _only_ one reporting on this. You really think TV|Line would miss out on that juicy news?

Stupid spoof sites.
