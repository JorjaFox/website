TV executives all over Hollywood must just want to beat Nina Tassler like a gong. The CBS Entertainment chief brought back "Jericho" for a deserved midseason run and admitted that the "Nuts to CBS" campaign by fans was a factor in the show's survival. Now every Comic Book Guy and No. #1 Fan out there is managing a campaign to save their favorite canceled show or fired actor. Aside from "Jericho" and "Cagney and Lacey" back in the '80s, there's seldom any sign that these campaigns are effective. The latest - again aimed in Tassler's direction - is a fan campaign for Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle, a supporting character on "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."

JorjaFox is leaving the show this season, reportedly due at least in part to a contract dispute with producers. (Remember the last time she and co-star George Eads demanded a raise, they came back with tails between their legs a few days later.) In addition to ditching the actress, the producers probably look forward to having Sara's boss, Gil Grissom, dating again. One of the pro-Fox groups has even been raising donations that provided a week's worth of flowers to Fox on the set, with messages accompanying each day's bouquet, such as "If we had a flower for all the times you've made us smile, we would have a garden to walk in forever."

Remember the famous "Saturday Night Live" skit with William Shatner at a "Star Trek" convention? Remember his advice to the gathered Trekkies, I mean, uh, Trekkers? "Get a life, people!"
