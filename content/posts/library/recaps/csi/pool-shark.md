## Synopsis

Hysteria ensues when a shark attacks a woman, Desiree McQuire, in the pool at a Las Vegas casino 'day club' and the CSIs must determine if the killer is human or shark. At the scene of the crime, Catherine runs into one of her father's old friends Earnest Boozell (played by Elliot Gould), and she has to forcibly remove him from the scene. He harasses Catherine about running casinos through much of the episode. At the autopsy, Ray and Doc Robbins find an injection site on the dead woman's back, and that she was dead before the shark attacked her body. The tox screen comes back and indicates she was injected with heroin, and it was a first time use.

When they determine the shark doesn't come from Boozell's tank, the prime suspect for the shark is the hotel down the block, Macklin's hotel, that also has a shark pool. Meanwhile, Anya Sanchez's prints are found on a hypodermic needle found in the pool. She confesses, and is stunned to find out her felony robbery has become a murder. At the shark autopsy, they determine the shark is Macklin's, due to the tag on it. Macklin admits that it was his, but the shark was an over-eater, and his 'shark guy' took care of it. The shark-guy happens to be the same vet that Boozell uses, Dr. Holloway.

Conveniently, Holloway is found dead in the shark tank at Boozell's, his oxygen tank tampered with and filled with car exhaust. The chemical ratios found in the tank matches those spewed from Boozell's car. The surveillance cameras show that a valet parker at Macklin's restaurant, Carne, used the exhaust from Boozell's car, while the two were making peace.

## Review
