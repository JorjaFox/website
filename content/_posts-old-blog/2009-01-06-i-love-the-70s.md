Or maybe you were just on summer break and didn't think your favorite star would do much over the summer. Then again, you could have suffered a breakdown with this new thing we called 'TiVo.'  Either way, you somehow managed to miss seeing Jorja on VH1s <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/I_Love_the_%2770s">I Love the '70s!</a>  And ever since then, those who got to watch it lorded over you, leaving you with nothing by the (rather small) screen caps to moon over.

Here now, is your salvation.
