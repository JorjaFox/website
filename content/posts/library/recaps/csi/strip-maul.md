## Synopsis

It's a busy night in Vegas and the CSIs are working the Strip with the police to help keep the peace. Nick bags a hooker and a drug dealer, while Sara finds a drugged out kid wearing a stuffed horse head. Then they're both called to the scene of a guy swinging his father's severed head around outside a casino. The head is fake, but in the chase to arrest him, the CSIs find Keith Dobson shot dead in a car.

The blood on the fake head was real pigs blood, and the video pranksters passed right by the car where the dead man was found. The CSIs collect the video camera, but his cohort, Lydia, is found dead nearby the video camera drop point.

The hooker, Chastity, was in possession of the engagement ring Jim Brass gave his (now) ex-wife, and had last been seen in Ellie's (his daughter's) possession. The ring was bought from Ellie, who is prostituting and now going by Jersey. Chastity's stolen debit card was also used to rent the car the dead man (Keith) was found in. Chastity had been hired by Keith and someone else.

The accidental ringleader behind the evening's mayhem was Bobby Reed, son of a city attorney, who was pushing drugs (that a transvestite was muleing), trading with another drug dealer, and hiring hookers. Chastity confesses her pimp (Roland Zaal, a local drug lord) had her keeping tabs on Bobby, and suspects Roland accidentally killed Keith when Chastity and Bobby left him in the car. Bobby's father explains that Keith is Bobby's roommate, and the transvestite was Josh, Bobby's cousin. Bobby's father convinces him to come in, and thus save Bobby from street justice.

The gun behind the killing was printed on a 3-D printer, owned by Roland Zaal, however trace of it was found on the hands of a, presumed, tourist witness, Anthony Paak. They trap Paak, but he won't turn on Zaal, and the printer can't be found. Chastity skips town before things get worse, but leaves Brass the ring.

## Review

Sara doesn't like working the street, and seems much more comfortable back in the lab.

The merry prankster calls her Detective Seagull, though Sara corrects him. When she arranges with his ex-girlfriend and cohort, Lydia, to drop the camera off in a newspaper dumpster. Sara does wonder why she still trusts people so much.

## Quotes

**Sgt. Weiss** It is a little crazy. Full moon tonight.
**Sara:** You know, not to discount the crazy, but no lunar affect on human behavior has ever been established.

**Sara:** This grass ain't hay.
