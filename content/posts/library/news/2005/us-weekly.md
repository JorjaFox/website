*CSI*'s Jorja Fox

&bull; **Bio** 36; born in New York, grew up in Melbourne Beach, Florida; currently single

&bull; **Offscreen style** "I'm edgier than [my character]," confesses L.A. resident Fox. On her down days, she slips into [7 for All Mankind](http://www.sevenjeansshop.com/) jeans and boots. But for going out, she favors outfits by BCBG, Prada or Theory. "BCBG fits me really well, and I can wear most of it off the rack," the star tells *Us*.

&bull; **Diet and fitness** No gym bunny here! Fox counts on surfing, hiking and running outside with her boxer dog, Ali, to stay in shape and relieve stress. Inside her fridge: seafood and veggies.

&bull; **Beauty tips** the low-maintenance actress prefers a "well-rested, healthy look" using soft shades of yellow and pink (like Armani Sheer Blush No. 2, $40, 877-551-7255). But she treats herself to massages every two weeks and oxygen facials at West Hollywood's Burke Williams [burkewilliamsspa.com](http://www.burkewilliamsspa.com). As for her hair: "I've always wanted to go Cameron Diaz-blonde."
