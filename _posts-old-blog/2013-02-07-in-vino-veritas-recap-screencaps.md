<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00033.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6314" alt="In Vino Veritas" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/02/vlcsnap-00033-250x250.jpg" width="275" height="140" /></a>First, Jorja is <em>not</em> in Friday's episode, so unless you're really into the case, you don't have to watch. I'll record it, but I probably won't watch. Nothing against NY, but I don't even watch CSI if Jorja's not in it.

For Sara, this case was interesting. There wasn't anything personal for Sara this time, though I thought I caught her flinching a little in the end interrogation. If I did half-stars, this would be a 3.5, since while Sara was a main character, we didn't have follow up from the Dead Air phone call. Except she is still wearing the ring. If this was Season 3 or 4, it would clearly have been four stars, so four is what I gave it.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/In_Vino_Veritas">Recap</a> (4 stars)</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season13/13vino/">Screencaps</a> (190)</li>
</ul>
Next week is Exile, and the week <em>after</em> that is Forget Me Not. Jorja is in both.
