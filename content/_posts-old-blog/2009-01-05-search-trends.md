Let's be honest.  "Jorja Fox" is rarely as high a search performer as, say, "Miley Cyrus" or "Harry Potter."  This is just the way the ball bounces when you're a fan of a vaguely known actor of whom people say "Hey, it's THAT chick!" when they see her on screen.  But still, Google keeps track of how many people search for "Jorja Fox" and the graph for the last four years is pretty interesting.

<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/01/googletrends-01.png" alt="googletrends-01" title="googletrends-01" width="589" height="266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1264" />

The data is scaled against itself.  In this case, I ran a search on the phrase "Jorja Fox" and the data is scaled against an average amount of search traffic for her between 2004 and the end of 2008.  That amount is represented as 1.0 on the graph.  The spikes are how many times the norm was a search performed, so that huge spike of 15 by the letter A? That's 15 times normal traffic.  You can read on the details <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html#7">here</a>.

I edited the graph to pick out slightly different times than they had on the default.
<ul>
	<li><strong>A</strong> - The week Jorja was fired from <em>CSI</em></li>
	<li><strong>B</strong> - The month before and after "Dead Doll" aired</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> - "Goodbye and Good Luck" aired</li>
</ul>

The other fun thing is that <strong>Canadians</strong> search for Jorja Fox more often than anyone else (though the USA is close behind).
