## Synopsis

The FBI get involved when 144 high powered guns (the FN-P90) are stolen and shipped to Nevada. One is used to kill Michael Newbury, retired Army Ranger, and cut him in half. His body is found in the hills near his home, his tattoo defaced to hide it. It's only after one of the guns shows up in a robbery that the FBI admit to how many guns may be in Las Vegas. Sara recovers the tattoo enough to determine it's of the 532nd Airborne which leads the combined forces to the guns nearly a step too late. Catherine and one of the FBI men are almost killed by the gunrunners, but survive and are able to turn the killer into a witness and recover all their losses. Except one. The company behind the guns remains suspect, and their CEO is married to one of Catherine's close friends.

## Review

Sara and Catherine go over the trajectory together and determine the killer was seated at the table when he shot Newbury.

She later works with Doc Robbins when the body comes in, and determines a way to use the document recovery scanner to scan in the tattoo defaced by the killers.

## Notes

* Sara plays with technology in a new way to help solve the case.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Catherine, who do you want to be? Victim or killer.\
**Catherine:** I'll be the killer.\
**Sara:** I'll be the victim. I've got a beer in my hand, standing in my own kitchen. I've got every kind of gun six meters that way. I'm heading that way when I'm shot.

**Sara:** The thing about tattoos, they're forever. Doc, can I take this part to go?\
**Robbins** Not yet, but we deliver.
