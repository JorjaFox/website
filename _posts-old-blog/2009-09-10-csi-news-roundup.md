They decided it was the perfect segue to tell us what's next on CSI.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/media/print/tvguide-20090914.jpg?z&p=full-image">Article Scan</a> credit <a href="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2009/09/tv-guide-scan-14th-sept-various-shows.html">Spoiler TV</a>. <br style="clear:left;" />

<blockquote>**Who's back -- and who's not** Riley Adams (Lauren Lee Smith) has left the building, making way for Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) to return for five episodes and help out the under-staffed lab.  "You definitely get some clues as to how things have been going in Grissom and Sara Land.  I mean, last time we saw them, they were kissing in the jungle," says [Naren] Shankar. Does that mean it's over?  Laughs Shankar, "It's not like she's got his shrunked head in her kit."</blockquote>

**Margamania** has some stills from <em>CSI</em>'s second episode of season 10, "Ghost Town" up. None are of Jorja, but Marg makes some great faces.

**CBS** has caught on to this whole viral social thing on the internet, and there is now an <a href="http://twitter.com/CSI_CBS">Official CSI Twitter Account</a> (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/CSI_CBS">@CSI_CBS</a>), and they have a CSI Channel on YouTube (which is US only, sorry).

And a bonus from <a href="http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/09/09/ask-ausiello-spoilers-on-gossip-girl-office-house-and-more/">Ask Ausiello</a>, the rumors about Louise Lombard (Sophia) returning to <em>CSI</em>? False.  There will be no return for her.
