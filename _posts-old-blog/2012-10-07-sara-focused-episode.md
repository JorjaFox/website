Per CSI Files, next week's "Code Blue Plate Special" will be personal to Sara.
<blockquote>... next week’s new installment titled <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/episodes/csi/season13/code_blue_plate_special.shtml" target="_blank">“Code Blue Plate Special”</a> will hit close to home. **Andrew Dettmann**‘s first writing credit for CSI puts the spotlight on one of the resident team members. “Sara is very prominent in the second episode,” a source close to the show tells CSI Files exclusively.

When Frank’s Diner, a popular establishment among the CSI team–and featured prominently in episodes such as <a href="http://www.csifiles.com/episodes/csi/season6/rashomama.shtml" target="_blank">“Rashomama”</a> and<a href="http://www.csifiles.com/episodes/csi/season9/mascara.shtml" target="_blank">“Mascara”</a>–becomes the target of a shooting spree, Sara finds herself emotionally invested in the case. “There’s a shooting at a diner with multiple fatalities and our CSIs are familiar with some of the patrons of the diner who are killed, one of whom she knows well,” the source continues. Adding, “It’s more of a Sara-focused episode.”

And while the CSIs are usually tasked with the pursuit of collecting and analyzing evidence, this time around “Sara’s more intimately involved in the pursuit of the killer.”</blockquote>
