<blockquote>**Question: What's this I hear about some unexpected surprise coming out in the _CSI_ premiere about Sara? —Encarni<br />Ausiello:** <a href="http://www.people.com/people/videos/0,,20306231,00.html">She got hitched to Grissom when no one was looking</a>. But that's old news. Here's some (relatively) new news from exec producer Naren Shankar: "Do not miss the first two-and-a-half minutes of _CSI_ season premiere. It will blow your mind. It may be one of the most incredible things we've ever put on film. It's so beautiful and it's so cool."

**Question: Any chance Jorja Fox may stick around full-time on _CSI_? Five episodes isn't enough. —Brian<br />Ausiello:** I posed that question to Shankar, and, based on his evasiveness, I would say it's probably being discussed. "I honestly can't say [for sure] at this point," he told me. "All I will say is we're having a great time and I think Jorja is having a great time. I think she's having more fun now than she did before. Having a little space from something, you get to clean your palate and be refreshed as an artist."</blockquote>
