**TV's No. 1 show finally investigates the team's private lives.**

*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* has always been stingy with details about the private lives of its workaholic characters, and they, in turn, don't know much about one another. But this "don't ask, don't tell" policy is about to backfire on forensics chief Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen). His crime lab will blow up in the May 8 episode, triggering revalations "that are bigger than the explosion itself," says Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer of the CBS hit. "A lot of emotions and truth will come to the surface." Grissom, who might have prevented the accident had he been aware of personal problems facing his staff, will be forced to deal with his own long-held secret- his loss of hearing. An unspoken attraction will also escalate, sort of. Teases Mendelsohn: "In just one word, Hrissom will say more about his feelings for Sara [Jorja Fox] than he could in 10 pages of dialouge." - *Michael Logan*
