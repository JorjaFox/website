From EW.com:

> UP NEXT: As part of a writer-exchange program, _Two and a Half Men_ exec producer Chuck Lorre is guest-scripting an April episode about a murdered sitcom diva. But in the first show back, exec producer Carol Mendelsohn playfully addresses the CSI team's absence during the strike by putting them on sick leave. ''They are all suffering from various stages of the flu,'' says Mendelsohn. ''Grissom is still home sick, so he has to get dragged out of bed to solve a case involving the death of a grand jury witness.'' Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) ends up going to Grissom's inner sanctum to talk about the case, and uses the visit to find answers about Sara's disappearance. ''By the end of the episode, the audience will have a better sense of where Sara and Grissom are with their relationship,'' promises Mendelsohn. It may just provide the cast with a little closure, too. ''We didn't have much time to get used to the idea of Jorja leaving, because soon after she left, we all shut down for the strike,'' says Eric Szmanda, who plays lab rat-turned-investigator Greg Sanders. ''That's one thing that will take a lot of time to get used to.''
