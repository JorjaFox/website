Well wow. Just wow. It's a four stars for Sara, and a return of sassy Sara. She was in pretty much 3/4ths of the episode, with science and smarts and generally awesomeness.

I have short hair, but I kept checking it all through the ep.

Did you see it coming? Did you like seeing lots of Sara? Did you think she'd be a Matt Damon or a Daniel Craig kind of girl? What was your favorite quote?
