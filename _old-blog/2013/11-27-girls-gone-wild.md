Also there's a <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/CSI-Girls-Gone-Wild-Finn-1073966.aspx">sneak peek of Finn at TV Guide</a>. But it's only Finn, so I'm not embedding it. Ditto the <a href="http://tvline.com/2013/11/27/csi-spoilers-kris-polaha-seduces-finlay-video/">TV Line peek of Finn getting to first base</a> (kissing).
