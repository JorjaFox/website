In baseball, a player hits for the cycle when he hits a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game, though not necessarily in that order. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a natural cycle.

On CSI, when you get a homicide, suicide, accidental death <em>and</em> a natural death in one shift, you hit the cycle.  All the boys need is a natural death to complete the cycle this Thursday.
