I really couldn't pick just one thing from the interview that I liked best, but I think I'm going to give you the bit from the episode I'd love to see:
<blockquote><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Every now and then there’s talk about meeting Sara’s mother. Is there someone you’d like to see play Laura Sidle?

<strong>Fox</strong>: Gosh, a whole bunch of people come to mind and probably a bunch of them are actually too young to be my mother. <strong>Susan Sarandon</strong> would be amazing.<strong>Mary Tyler Moore</strong> would be amazing. Let me think here… <strong>Kathy Bates</strong> would be amazing, but she’s pretty busy and has her own show now. That’s one other thing that’s so great is that there’s always something to look forward to. We’ve been talking about Sara’s mother since season four or five and so just knowing that this storyline is out there in the ethers may happen is something to look forward to. I would imagine the intensity of stuff between those two women would be pretty insane in an entertaining way.</blockquote>
