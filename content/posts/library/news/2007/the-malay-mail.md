**GET ready for more intriguing crimebusting as our hardworking Las Vegas Crime Scene Investigators return on AXN in a brand new season that is "built to kill".**

[...]

And finally, fans of gossip and rumours get something hot this season &#8212; a passionate secret affair! Just as the crimes become more intense, the sexual and emotional attraction between team leader Gil Grissom and the freckled Sara Sidle brews under the covers.

Fans of the series were teased with an intimate bedroom scene of the two in last season's cliffhanger finale.

This time, you will see the two let their relationship develop further under the radar of their sharp CSI colleagues.

This should be a fun subplot to follow, as it would be a secret that only viewers will be aware of.

Wait &#8212; secret lover and workaholic Grissom goes on leave? What's going on with our beloved CSI? We asked, both William Petersen and Jorja Fox to fess up.

"We've been together for a while; it's just that no one knew it," said Petersen, the cute guy who plays Gil Grissom.

"It's an interesting thing to play and it's somewhat fought with danger.

"In Grissom's mind, it's a secret affair.

I don't think he knows what will happen.

I think their relationship would be a disturbance to the rest of the team.

It wouldn't be good for Grissom as he's a supervisor, and it wouldn't be good for Sara who's his subordinate.

They realise the conflict, which makes for interesting drama."

Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, added, "From the very beginning, I knew that there was the possibility of me having a love affair with Grissom.

When we got through seasons one and two, I think everyone realised that this show was going to stick, and we didn't want to blow our wad too soon.

We didn't want to get them together too early on because if they broke up, there would be a good amount of awkwardness that would linger.

It was wise to hold back on it and then we thought maybe fans weren't interested in it anymore.

"Out of the blue, I got a call from Carol Mendelsohn suggesting, &#8216;Hey do you want to do this?' I don't know how often actors get those calls.

I was surprised and intrigued.

I thought it could make season seven very interesting.

I always loved the storyline between Grissom and Sara; it's a bit scandalous and untraditional.

We are still trying to find the road that we are going to take on that storyline."

A secret affair must be frustrating.

"I think Sara wonders why it's still a secret, because it's not like they started sleeping together two weeks ago," said Fox.

"There's motivation that if people knew they were together, they should switch shifts because he is her supervisor.

One of the things they feel very passionate about is the work and they love working together.

"The first part of the season for Sara and Grissom was letting the dust settle.

We had dropped this proverbial bomb and the fans were in on something that the characters were not and we wanted to let that play out and breathe for a while.

The second half of the season might be about the paradise lost between the two of them."

A secret affair usually ceases to be a secret sooner or later, especially with the CSI's closed-knit relations, the other team members would surely sniff the "closeness" between those two eventually? "Grissom is self-contained and seemingly socially-inept," said Petersen.

"I think of this as a choice as opposed to a flaw.

People are constantly wondering about his passions and his humanness.

He's very close to the chest.

It becomes a puzzle in and of itself.

Our audience is also challenged to solve puzzles about relationships with the characters."
