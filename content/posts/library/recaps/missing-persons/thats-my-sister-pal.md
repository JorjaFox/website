## Synopsis

While Connie and Carlos investigate the disappearance of a young Latino newly arrived from Mexico, Johnny has assigned himself an &#8220;unofficial&#8221; case. He thinks Connie's husband is cheating on her and decides to find out for sure. Enlisting an unwilling Bobby, who is working a case involving the disappearance of a middle-aged widower, they find out more than they want to know. Ray, contacted by the wife of a missing old colleague of his, has to find the man. He does, also finding out more than he wants know.

## Review

Connie comes in with a bad mood, and when Bobby asks her where the days donuts are, Connie snarks that she shouldn't have to get them every day. Johnny senses her bad mood, but Connie refuses to talk to him about it and asks for some time off because she might have cancer. Instead she works with Carlos on a case of a missing Latino immigrant, to keep her mind off things. While helping Carlos, a ground of gangbangers attempt to harass her, but she holds her own. When the missing boy's sister is beaten by the gangbangers, Connie confesses that she too has been a victim and urges the girl to speak out against her attackers, which she does and has him arrested.

Johnny looks into her husband, Richard, who he saw kidding a woman in a bar. At the address of Karadzic Plumbing, Johnny sees Richard getting into a car with a woman he calls 'honey' and Richard has a phone number at her apartment. Johnny finally confronts Richard, who explains Connie isn't his wife, she's his sister. Richard and Connie's father explain to Johnny that Connie's divorced, and her husband used to beat her. While Richard supports this, Connie's father claims that she should have made it work, and this is the heart of a family dispute.

## Notes

* No one at the office has ever met Connie's husband.
* Carlos asks about Connie's claim to being a victim, but Connie says little more than it's why she became a cop.
* Connie has a cancer scare, made worse when the hospital looses her records, but in the end, she's fine.
* Connie tells Johnny that she appreciates his concern, and asks him to keep his mouth shut about what he learned.

## Quotes

**Bobby:** Yo, yo, Connie! What's up? Where da donuts?
