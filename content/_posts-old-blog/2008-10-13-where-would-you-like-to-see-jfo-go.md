We're stickin' around for the foreseeable future, but I feel you guys should have a say in the future so I'm dropping this poll in for you.

<center>[poll id="28"]</center>

&bull; Videos - Would you like to see videos added to JFO?  Likely we'd host them via YouTube.
&bull; Forums - Yes, I'm offering a return of the forums.
&bull; More Bloggers - Should I go find more people to post JFO news?
&bull; Fundraising - Should we start gearing ourselves to ongoing fundraising for Jorja's causes?
&bull; None - You like things the way they are, please don't change.
&bull; Something Else - If you have another idea, please comment here.

So that's it!  We'll run this poll for the rest of the month, I'll look over the answers and see where we look like we're going.
