## Synopsis

A sudden rainstorm washes away the evidence Grissom, Warrick, Sara and Nick are collecting after an apparent car jacking that ended in a triple homicide. Meanwhile, Catherine investigates a collapse of a building that killed three senior citizens.

## Review

The case appears to be a carjacking/murder, but a sudden rain storm threatens to wash away the evidence. Despite what he told her earlier about getting a life outside the lab, Grissom calls Sara in on her day off. Sara runs around taking photos in a frenzy while the rest of the team collects what evidence that they can. Sara and Grissom question the witness, and Sara collects the witness' clothes.

Sara brings Grissom personal information on the murdered couple, and wonders why someone would fight to death for a car. At the autopsy (in what is a recurring minor theme), David Phillips smiles at Sara. This time she returns it.

With Brass, Sara takes the knife tip removed from a body to a shop to determine what type and brand of dagger it is. She also helps Warrick get prints from the car and compares them with the third victim, whom Grissom has just brought in. Nick gets Sara and Warrick to recreate the crime scene, which when they compare their conjecture to the state of the witness' clothes, proves via evidence that the witness is actually the killer; Sara gets mad at herself because she believed the witness' story. Going through the victim's bank records, Sara finds out it was a deliberate double hit.

## Notes

* Sara likes the drying room, where clothing evidence is kept, because it's 'peaceful and quiet'.
* Sara is 'played' by a suspect, showing a tendency to believe what people tell her at face value.
* Sara doesn't mind when Phillips flirts with her.
