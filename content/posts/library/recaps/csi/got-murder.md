## Synopsis

Some bird watchers find a raven with a human eyeball in its mouth. This eventually leads our CSIs to a divorced man and his 2 children but not much else. Warrick and Grissom look into the circumstances of David's unusual and first autopsy. This takes them to a car dealership where the man worked.

## Review

Sara works with Catherine and Nick on the body found in the dump, and she is the one to find the bloodstains in the kitchen. Examining the victim's suitcase, Sara 'models' lingerie for Nick (holds it up in front of herself). Sara is, unsurprisingly, displeased when it appears that the father may be having sex with his daughter.

## Notes

* Sara is aware of the ecological and environmental impact of Nevada's trash habits.

## Quotes

**Sara:** You know the average Nevadan generates more than three times waste than the average American?\
**Nick:** Yeah, well, that's tourist trash.\
**Sara:** Thirteen million pounds per day. I went to the recycling forum in March.

**Sara:** It's like peeling an onion into peoples' lives.\
**Catherine:** Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly.

**Sara:** Well, she wasn't in town on business.\
**Nick:** What's that? _((looks at Sidle))_
**Sara:** _((turns around and holds a black teddy in front of her, then clicks her tongue and shakes the teddy in front of her))_

**Sara:** She's a virgin? What are we talking, immaculate conception?\
**Catherine:** More like the immaculate perception. 'Pseudocyesis' -- imagined pregnancy.\
**Sara:** It's all in her head? Well, that would explain what she was doing in dad's bed.
