I missed the live tweets being out at the hockey game (and then stayed up late to review and recap for you), but it was actually a really good episode. As much as I don't like the whole "two cases related!" schtick, this was well told and well filmed. Everyone was in good form.

No new CSI next week, but the week after is "Love for Sale" which Jorja is <em>not</em> in. Sorry.
