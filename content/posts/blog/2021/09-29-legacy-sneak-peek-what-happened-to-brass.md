If you can't see the video it's probably region locked, so check out the full article.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Onetime CSI Sara Sidle and her former boss Jim Brass have a lot to catch up on — including the whereabouts of one Catherine Willows — in this exclusive sneak peek from CBS’ <a href="http://tvline.com/tag/csi-vegas">_CSI: Vegas_</a>.For one thing, Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) has been suffering from Fuchs corneal disease, though keeping the sad sitch to himself. Oh, and as alluded to in the clip above, he has been the target of a death threat.Sara (Jorja Fox) in turns explains why neither former colleagues Catherine (played on the original _CSI_ by Marg Helgenberger) nor Gil Grissom (William Petersen) are with her for this mini-reunion.<cite><a href="https://tvline.com/2021/09/29/csi-vegas-video-sara-sidle-update-where-is-catherine-willows-marg-helgenberger/">_CSI: Vegas_ Sneak Peek: Sara Sidle Updates Jim Brass on Catherine and Gil</a></cite></blockquote>

Do you think Jim's really riding his Harley while mostly blind?
