Â And no work yet on how many episodes (if any) we should expect Jorja to be in.

So pretty much all we know is that _CSI_ will be back on September 21st (that's a Wednesday!) at 10pm ET/9pm CT.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/tv-guide-magazine/cbs-unveils-fall-launch-dates-sticks-with-premiere-week/249339448414191">TV Guide remarks</a>:
<blockquote>Tradition-minded CBS is sticking with a pretty tradition-minded fall roll out. While the other networks look to stagger their fall 2011 launches a bit more than usual, CBS is sticking with a fall roll-out that centers mostly on the first week of the TV season (starting Sept. 19).</blockquote>
Full details (such as they are) can be found on <a href="http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=28633">CBS Press Express</a>, but really there isn't much.

Speculate away!
