I know everyone wants to know about Grissom. But Matt points out that Jorja brings a lot back to the show, with or without Mr. Sidle.

<blockquote>[...]

**Question: **Just read that Jorja Fox is returning as Sara Sidle on _CSI_, though it is not known yet whether she'd come back as a recurring star, as she has been since her initial "return," or as a regular cast member. Though I was happy to read the news &mdash; I think the show is better when Fox is on it &mdash; I'd be happy if she does a recurring role because then she'd still be Sara Sidle Grissom, but if it's as a regular, I would think her tie with Gil would have to be eliminated, and I've rather liked the mentions because I still think the show lost a lot when Grissom (William Petersen) left. I know that sounds rather "female," and silly of me to want to hold on to some of the Grissom-ness, but I'd bet a lot of people feel the same way. How about you? Do you think Jorja adds to the cast, and that the "association" helps? Or does it really not matter in the scheme of things? &mdash; _Dorothy_

**Matt Roush:** Whether Jorja Fox is full-time or part-time on the show, the continuity she brings to long-time fans as a link to the much-missed Grissom is probably invaluable. I'm glad she's sticking around.
