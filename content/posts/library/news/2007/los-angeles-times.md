## This 'CSI' snoop knows how to locate L.A.'s vegetarian options

YOU know the face. Jorja Fox has had major roles in three of TV's biggest hits -- "ER" (as Dr. Maggie Doyle), "The West Wing" (as Agent Gina Toscano) and for the last seven seasons as Investigator Sara Sidle on CBS' "CSI." Keep your eye out tonight for this single-but-involved, very vegetarian L.A. resident. She's featured in a "CSI" episode called "Empty Eyes."

A microbrew and a song

One of my favorite restaurants is within walking distance from my house, **Blair's** in Silver Lake. It's got a very bistro vibe, American contemporary cuisine and a fantastic wine list. The place is mostly candle-lit, and they play cool ambient jazz. The menu is seasonal and pulls a lot of stuff from the Pacific Northwest, so you'll find huckleberries, linden berries, freshwater fish. They do unbelievable things with side dishes; I love the cauliflower and braised Brussels sprouts, and the truffled mac 'n' cheese.

If I was in the mood for a nightcap, there's a bar across the street called the **Edendale Grill**, which is a converted firehouse. They have a cool 40-foot-long bar, microbrews on tap and a lot of great martini drinks. There's usually a good crowd there long after the dinner hour; they attract a vibrant, late-night cocktail fan.

I have a little karaoke machine in my living room, so that would be my final stop. I have a horrible voice -- I don't subject strangers to my singing -- but I will sing in front of friends for hours.

**Hold the meat, please**

On Saturday, I'll have brunch at the **Brite Spot** in Echo Park, a diner that's been around forever. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years -- I think I'm a lifer -- and they make vegetarian versions of anything, like a BLT or a meatloaf dinner. They have amazing spinach and tofu enchiladas and breakfast quesadillas with soy cheese.

After that I'd go to a little place in Atwater Village called **D-Tox Day Spa**. It's small but beautiful. I'm not the type that can spend a whole day at a spa, but I'm good for the 80-minute Swedish massage. If I still have the energy, I'll get a pedicure. I don't bother with manicures, and, believe me, it shows.

After that I'd take my dog, Ali, for a walk in Elysian Park. Or maybe go to Griffith Park and see the sunset from the observatory.

Dinner might be at **Masa**, a joint owned by two Chicago families. The place specializes in brick-oven pizza, both deep dish and thin crust, which you can order with soy cheese. They have veggie sausage sandwiches, and the niÃ§oise salad is out of this world.

On the way home I'd stop by the **Short Stop**, a great dive bar, for a Bailey's and decaf.

**Drumming up support**

On Sunday I like to sleep late, then head out to the **Brick House Cafe** in Venice for brunch. Very casual, great coffee, and they have a lot of vegetarian options.

Then I'd hit the beach and surf for a couple of hours. There's a huge drumming circle that I take part in sometimes, and it's great to do as the sun goes down. Sometime hundreds of people are playing. That's why I always bring my drum or a tambourine when I go to Venice.

On the way home, I'll head out to Tarzana, where there's a five-star vegan restaurant called **Madeleine's**, very healthy and flavorful. To cap off the weekend, I'd have a glass of organic wine with dinner.
