Ted Danson has built up a lot of goodwill among audiences after appearing on such hits as "Cheers," "Damages," and "Becker." But that goodwill might not extend to his new costars on "CSI."

[..]

Is it possible that, in his zeal to help save the show from cancellation, Ted Danson is rubbing some castmates the wrong way? Sure. A lot of the "CSI" cast has been on the show from the beginning and probably have their own ways of working together. But the fact is, he's Ted Danson. He's television royalty. Thirty years after "Cheers" debuted, he's still working and highly respected, and audiences still know who he is and love him. In 30 years, will anyone know or care who George Eads and Jorja Fox are? "CSI" already fired those two once, so if they're that expendable... probably not. So if Ted Danson has a suggestion for how to block a scene, it would probably be in their best interest to listen to him. There's a right way and a wrong way of doing things, granted. But he's Ted freaking Danson! They're not.
