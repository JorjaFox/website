## Synopsis

When a car with no driver goes through the drive-in window at Tasty Time, the CSIs are on a surprising case with an extra brain. The brain was in the car of a junkie and former MMA fighter named Danny Clegg, who had it in a cooler in his passenger seat when he OD'd at the fast food joint.

The brain had been removed by a doctor in Seneca, Hanson Eller, and belonged to an MMA fighter named Ryan Dempsey. Dempsy thought he had Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and donated his brain to research. He had committed apparent suicide, and Dr. Eller removed the brain at the direction of Dempsey's trainer, Bill Pernin. Clegg then went to a mortuary and stole the brain of Lt. Seligson, a recently deceased soldier, who was waiting for his burial in the morning. He traded it with Dr. Eller, who was then shot, at the behest of Pernin, who had been giving his fighters drugs for years and din't want that to come out on review, as it would destroy his career.

But Dempsey was murdered, not a suicide. His wife had been having an affair with Pernin, and when Dempsey found out, he threatened her. His son, Declan, shot him, and the wife called Pernin who helped cover up the murder and then attempted to protect his own interests.

Of course, Pernin hadn't known that Dempsey and Clegg had a different plan. Dempsey had given Clegg his high school game football, in which he had stored syringes with drugs that Pernin had given him. It was Pernin who shot Dr. Eller following the brain swap, hoping to cover that up.

## Review

Sara and Nick go over Clegg's car and find a yellow residue, which Sara is later able to match at the mortuary where Lt. Seligson rested, thus linking the scenes and Clegg. Later she and Greg go over Cleeg's receipts and find surveillance footage of Clegg and Dr. Eller meeting. She and Brass confront Pernin about the drugs found on both Clegg and Dempsey.

## Notes

* Sara gives Hodges grief about eating fast food.
