## Summary

Greene hires a new desk clerk. High on morphine, Dr. Morganstern gives Weaver increased authority while he recuperates from his heart attack. Doug asks Carol for a drawer at her place. Dr. Corday adjusts to the differences between British and U.S. ERs. Dr. Greene is served with a wrongful death suit from the Law family. Carter trains a med student who is better at research than treating patients. Mark and Carol interview applicants for a vacant desk clerk position. Benton and Carla name their son: Reese Benton.

## Review

Because Carter switched tracks from surgery to ER, Maggie now 'outranks' him, and Carter is irritated at having to run all his cases past her.

## Notes

* Maggie is the senior ER resident
