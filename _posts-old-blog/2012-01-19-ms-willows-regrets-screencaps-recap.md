Sara also charged into a house with her gun, and totally had Catherine's back. It was impossible to watch those scenes without knowing what was coming.

It's nice to see that Sara can talk about this now.

The episode ends on a cliffhanger, but don't worry, I'm pretty sure Catherine doesn't die.

Bugman was Nick.

Natalie was mentioned by Sara.

"Weeping Willows" was ... Anyone?
