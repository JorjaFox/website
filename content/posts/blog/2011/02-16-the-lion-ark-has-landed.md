They landed about two hours late, which is pretty impressive, considered how many hours delayed the lions were last time, and how much more coordination was involved!  By 6:30pm the lions were being offloaded, while ADI Spokesperson Corey Evans, and Ambassadors Bob Barker and Jorja Fox talked to the media.  Since it wasn't the middle of the night, there were more media heads out there videoing and photographing (not to mention <a href="http://twitter.com/AnimalDefenders">@AnimalDefenders</a> live tweeting the whole thing).

ADI's Tim Phillips spoke to the media, as did Bob Barker and Jorja Fox.

More photos will be posted up at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/adi/20110216-adi-lionark/">Operation: Lion Ark Gallery</a> as they come in, so don't expect this post to get updated with _every_ picture.

At this point, the lions are being unloaded off the plane and onto the trucks.  I'll post again if we get videos.
