## Synopsis

Boxer Lorenzo Morales, nicknamed Happy, is found dead at Binky's World Famouse Sugar Cane Ranch, where he is living and training. Too fond of drugs and whores, he pissed off most of the prostitutes at the Ranch. Binky was angry with Happy for taking liberties with the girls, while his wife Doris had a 'thing' for Happy. All the girls had various weapons in their rooms, but the multitude of injuries and attacks on Happy make it difficult to determine how he died.

One of the prostitutes had injected Happy with snake venom, with the help of the bartender. But the venom didn't kill Happy, and he finds Doris, who gives him a blow job after eating shrimp, to which he is allergic. Now in anaphylactic shock, Happy gets shot throught the throat with a crossbow bolt, then goes back to the prostitute who hits him with a crowbar. Happy staggers off to the pool, where he sits on a weak chair and falls in and drowns.

## Quotes

**Sara:** This is one pool I'm not feeling a pressing need to take a dip in.

**Sara:** You've never paid for sex?
**Grissom:** I have not. I find the whole idea very... bleak.
**Sara:** Really. How come?
**Grissom:** Sex should provide the opportunity for human connection, but paid sex does the opposite of that. To me, sex without love is... pointless.
**Sara:** Well I'm pretty sure I don't make you sad.
**Grissom:** No. You make me happy.
