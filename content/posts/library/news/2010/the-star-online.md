Welcome home, Jorja Fox. Even as we longed for her return as Sara Sidle (a.k.a. Mrs Gil Grissom) on *CSI*, Fox said she had been missing her onscreen persona, her cast-mates and the show terribly.

So much that she had to restrain herself from tuning in.

...I stopped watching* CSI* because I figured the sadness would go away if I don't watch it," the 48-year-old actress said in a recorded interview. ...But it didn't work."

So imagine her happiness when the executive producers of *CSI* Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar invited her to revisit the Vegas strip for a few episodes.

...I was flattered that they called me and asked me whether I would like to come back," explained Fox, dropping hints that she might be back on *CSI* indefinitely. ...I'm initially supposed to be back for five episodes. But who knows, I might decide to stay longer."

...It's like a complete new show for me now. I like the feeling. I'm struggling with my kit and I have problems putting on my gloves at speed."

Just for the record, Fox -- who was part of the *CSI* original ensemble cast since its inception in 2000, left the show in 2008, citing that she was ...burnt out".

Really?

...I was exhausted," she explained. ...I really needed a break. I wanted to stay away from Hollywood to a certain extent. I was missing my life, my family and my friends. They got to see me more on TV than in person."

It so happens that the theme of *CSI* season 10 is ...family".

...You know, it feels like I never left the show at all. Everyone treats me like family there. Even Laurence Fishburne has been asking me, 'Are you staying put with us or not?'"

Well, be prepared for a happier Sara who will hold her *CSI *family together this season, now that Fox has had time to get her batteÂ­ries recharged.
