**Jorja Fox** Wow, um. Thank you. I'm hearing that, people have been saying that. And that's amazing, I think- You know, the other reason that I thought the show was going to flop was because it was about science. And I thought that was going to be a very hard thing to make to look fascinating and interesting and exciting to people. I thought it was very fascinating, like reading the script I had a tremendous amount of faith in the show and I just had no idea how we would pull it off. So if people responded in that kind of way where they actually maybe kind of might be more interested in science than they were, that's a pretty cool thing. And science is great because it's evolving every day, as well as technology and a lot of the computer stuff- A lot of the stuff we get to do on the show is groundbreaking technology and it's going to continue to do that over the next maybe five to ten years, so it's a great time to be telling these stories. There's never an ending amount of new ideas and it's probably a really good time for people to get into the field. It's going to be interesting to see how many people will stick around, cause, you know, there's certain things on TV that we can't really share with the audience. Like the smell! "(laugh)" Some of the more horrible aspects of doing the job. So I'm interested to see what happens.
