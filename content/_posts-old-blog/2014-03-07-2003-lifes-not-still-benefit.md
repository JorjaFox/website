Surprising find, I must say. I've always wondered where the photos were from, and finally I was able to sort that one out.

[gallery ids="10112,10110,10111"]

These are all the photos I have. Any more that show up will be in the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/benefits/20030607-lifenotstill/">"Life's Not Still" gallery</a>.
