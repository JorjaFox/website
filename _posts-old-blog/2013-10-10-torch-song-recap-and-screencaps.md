This was _barely_ three stars, and that mostly for Sara's scene volume. Not a great For Sara episode, but I loved her new haircut, and she had a nice number of scenes on camera. On the downside, the episode was in the dark, literally, so the screencap quality is low. Not enough light. Yes, I did complain about that out loud.

I enjoyed the episode. I was hoping Kevin and/or his mom, or Miller the Fire Dude, to be the killers. I like them when they're built up and _not_ the name of the week. Also I was sort of hoping Sara would be the one to punch Caleb in the face, but it was very appropriate Bad Ass Brass did it.

Remember: Sara's not in next week's episode, but the week _after_ that is episode #300.
