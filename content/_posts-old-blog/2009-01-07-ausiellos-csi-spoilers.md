But this is important.  Grissom's final episode is going to run long, so pad your DVRs, VCRs, and whatever other recording equipment you've got by at <em>least</em> ten minutes.  Also, expect WP on the cover of Friday's EW magazine.

<blockquote><strong>Question: Any scoop on Grissom's last episode of <em>CSI</em>? -- Nicole</strong>
<strong>Ausiello:</strong> Just a tip: Set your DVR to record a few minutes past 10 pm on Jan. 15, just as a precaution. You do <em>not</em> want to miss the final scene. Trust me. Also, you'll want to pick up a copy of the new EW when it goes on sale this Friday. I think you'll fancy the cover subject.</blockquote>
