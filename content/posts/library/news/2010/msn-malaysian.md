After a four year break, Jorja's returning to the hit crime drama series CSI and MSN Entertainment has got the latest on her character, Sara Sidle and what's up and coming for Season 10 of CSI.

**Q: Tell us what is it like leaving CSI and then coming back again after a break?**

**A:** Well when I was on CSI, I was really exhausted and literally crying. I said to the executive producer when I left that I would love to visit sometime. I think they heard I wanted to come back because I took a four year break to try and stay out of Hollywood. When they heard I was going back to work they called me to come and visit and I was completely flattered and surprised that they will ever call again. I was excited to return because in some ways I was seeing old friends again but in another way this was brand new to me. So I went in there mentally thinking that I wanted to start fresh which is very exciting. I remember being so slow at the beginning when I had to learn the ropes of everything again like a new person. I was holding up many scenes making the day so much longer. But now I'm much up to speed again.

**Q: How did the other cast members react to your return especially the newest cast member, Laurence Fishburne who plays Dr. Raymond Langston?**

**A:** He has been so kind and so gracious and even the rest of the old cast members, they are so kind and so very patient with me.

**Q: Sarah Sidle has always had a moody presence on the show. Is she a happier person in Season 10? Did she find happiness away from the streets of Las Vegas? Also, did you manage to find your own happiness away from CSI?**

**A:** Yes and yes. I have really tried to bring a change to Sara this year by trying to bring a sort of more joyful presence in her. She left to bury her ghosts and the idea is she comes back as if she never separated with the rest. Now that she's not fighting her own demons she doesn't have to be as dark about her stories she's involved in. That's the conscious effort on my path this year. I was so tired when I left this show.I was so lucky to be able to do 12 years in a row of primetime television, stage and other various pieces before CSI.

**Q: Does Sara's return in season 10 bring back some of the old magic now that two of the original cast members, Warrick and Grissom are gone?**

**A:** Oh, I don't think that's a question for me but for the fans. (Laughs) Originally I never thought I would to return without William Peterson there. He and I worked for so many years and I couldn't imagine the show without him. I miss him and the both of them are irreplaceable characters on the show. However, it has been so fun to be back on the show and work with everybody. It has been a fantastic experience working with William. He really is a great guy and a terrific actor.

**Q: You have been playing the character of Sara for a long time now; do you find any similarities between you and her?**

**A:** All the time. I'll buy a skirt put in the closet and six months later think who bought that skirt! (Laughs) I'm really similar to Sarah and it has been a great advantage for me. Playing this character for 10 years really helps if I'm like her or if we have small things in common. I hope that little things of her rub off on me. She's very brave and she's much smarter than me. Also, Sara is very serious and focused. However, I'm also glad we're different in some ways because sometimes when I put on my jacket I feel like her and I have never experienced that before.

**Q: In CSI, you have to say a lot of technical terms and there's a lot of to memorize. Was it tough for you?**

A: Yes it was tough but we did a lot of research at the beginning of the show. After returning to the show again, I had difficulty trying to remember the technical terms or even some of the simple things like opening a kit box. Luckily my cast mates were really patient but it was very embarrassing. After being back for six months I'm slowly getting my pace again.

**Q: If you had to choose your favourite scenes in CSI, what will you pick?**

**A:** I would say thescenes with William Peterson. (Laughs) He was a great guy and also it was rare wherewe had scenes together which makes it so special especially the scene at the end where they kissed. I was afraid that coming back would be weird because it almost seemed the story had ended there.

**Q: The Sara-Griffith romance has sparked much debate to fans as some love it but some hate it. Will there be more of Sara and Griffith this season? And why do some fans really protest over this romance?**

**A:** I guess it's a good thing. I've question myself that several times but the show's had a history where half of the fans want more personal storylines and half of the fans who just want to see the show. So whenever the writers' are telling a story they are always disappointing someone. A couple of years ago, the writers' decided to just follow their hearts because they are always going to let somebody down no matter which story they are telling. For me and my ego, at least the people hate the story but the emotional response is strong enough. It is better than to not care about the show.

**Q: After 10 seasons, CSI has shown the fans almost everything, are there any surprises left and what can the fans expect?**

**A:** Yes there are many surprises. We haven't done so many stories on characters and there is more possibility of further venturing into that like Catherine is finally going to get a love interest. (Laughs) She's been waiting a long time for this. As for stories, sadly there would not be a shortage of stories of crime and violence in America. It's a sad fact actually but it is really good for our show.

**Q: What are your thoughts on the popularity of CSI? It has managed to have two have other spin-offs CSI: New York and CSI: Miami.**

**A:** It's always a surprise. I and my co-workers still are surprised that after 10 years we're still going strong. It's definitely a compliment to the show and I guess I do wonder whether the audience we get are starting to look for other things as you mention there are so many other shows and so many different stories. Unfortunately there's no shortage of stories in America asit has so much stories to tell. It's just been a great magic carpet ride. And if I do stand back and observe objectively, I would say the show's got a few more years of life in it.

**Q: What's the best thing about being Jorja Fox right now?**

**A:** I think the best thing is things could be a lot worse. I'm a very lucky person. I was able to take a year off which was a very terrifying risk and when I was done with my year off, the people I love and admired who I worked with for so long welcomed me back as if I never left. That's a really nice feeling. They took me in their arms and told me let's go to work.

**Q: What's the worst thing about being you right now?**

**A:** The worst thing is we had some crazy weather over here and the hardest thing about filming is not knowing whether we will be filming in the rain or freezing cold temperature.

**Q: I'm sure you're a fan of many actors and directors but are there any directors you would like to work with in the future?**

**A:** Oh My God, there are so many. Right now I would like to work with James Cameron.
