The first airing of "Forget Me Not" hits the UK, and Radio Times ain't shy about who they root for.
<blockquote>It’s not unheard of in the annals of crime drama for a member of a tight-knit law-enforcement team suddenly to find the tables turned. One of our heroes is a murder suspect themselves. How will they prove their innocence?

Tonight these classic woes befall poor Sara Sidle when a man chats her up in a hotel dining room and is then found dead the next day, with Sara’s hair in his shower drain. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, either — she’s already unbalanced by the latest twists in her relationship with king-over-the-water Gil Grissom. All her colleagues are treating her like a liar. Nice to know who your friends are.

<strong>ABOUT THIS PROGRAMME</strong>

15/22. Sara celebrates her birthday in a hotel with recent acquaintance Taylor Wynard, who is found dead the next morning having been stabbed with a steak knife. After Finn sends her home to get some rest, Sara gets the shock of her life when she opens her dishwasher and finds the murder weapon inside, while the team discovers a necklace belonging to her behind the victim's bed and records from her key card indicate she didn't return to her room when she said she did. Drama, starring Jorja Fox.</blockquote>
