I'm a tech-head/nerd by nature, and a lot of the time the science on _CSI_ makes me roll my eyes.  For example, on _Mythbusters_, they proved you **can not** fill a safe with water and explode it to get at the valuables inside.  And yes, I did shout "BUSTED!" at the TV when Nick said that they did it on _Mythbusters_.  While I'm willing to give lenience to a lot of things in the interest of good television, I dislike it when they do things with computers that just aren't possible.

Imagine my delight to find out that there is a real product that acts as a database for gun and gang related crimes, pulling it down to location, style of killing, and shells found at the scene!  It's one of those things people would look at and wonder why it hadn't been done before.  AFIS, for example, tracks guns, but why not correlate that with the other information and make it a monster search tool?  ShieldOps made two programs, GunOps and Gang Injunction, to do just that.

The co-inventor, Rocky Edwards, went to the set of _CSI_ to see how the fictional version of his product.  The one they used on the show was, what ShieldOps hopes, the future of where their product will end up.
