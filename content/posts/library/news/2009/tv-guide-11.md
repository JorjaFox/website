 Jorja Fox is returning to "CSI" as Sara Sidle.

Fox will appear in the Season 10 premiere (airing Sept. 24) and additional episodes, says CBS.

"We're thrilled for Jorja's return," "CSI" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told The Associated Press. With the actress' encore, viewers will "discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the "CSI" team in Las Vegas."

An original "CSI" cast member, Fox formally left the hit crime drama at the end of 2007-08 season. Her character repeatedly returned in Season 9, and reunited with colleague/romantic interest Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen, who has exited the show as well).

A CBS rep at this time has no comment on whether Petersen himself might return this season with Fox.
