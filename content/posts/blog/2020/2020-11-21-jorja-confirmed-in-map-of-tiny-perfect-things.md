As reported by "All About Jorja," Jorja is [confirmed](https://www.ioncinema.com/news/festival-predictions/2021-sundance-film-festival-ian-samuels-the-map-of-tiny-perfect-things) in the cast of _[The Map of Tiny Perfect Things](https://jorjafox.net/library/actor/map-of-tiny-perfect-things/)_

{{< tweet user="AllJorja" id="1329973858418495488" >}}

The fantasy/drama is directed by Ian Samuels, from a screenplay byÂ Lev Grossman, based upon Grossman's short story of the same name.

The plot is about two teens who live the same day repeatedly, thus enabling them to create the titular map.

Jorja will portray Greta, mother to Margaret (one of the teens).

The movie is due out in 2021, though right now no one can say what form that will take. Personally I suspect streaming media will be the way.
