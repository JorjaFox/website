Axed *CSI* actors George Eads and Jorja Fox look set to be reinstated on the cast of the crime drama, according to reports today.

The duo were both dropped by the show's broadcast network CBS last week after failing to show for the first day of filming on the upcoming fifth season. Network chief Leslie Moonves cited an ongoing dispute over pay as the reason for their no-show and subsequent dismissal.

Now both actors claim the whole affair was a "misunderstanding" and expect to be back on the show within days.

"They think it's about money and it's not," Eads told reporters Wednesday. "I overslept. ... I woke up white as a sheet 3 1/2 hours after I was supposed to be on the set."

He added that after calling in to say he was on his way, he was told "don't bother."

Eads said he had apologised for the mistake and was keen to make a comeback. "Let me tell you, I've apologised nine ways to Sunday. It's a big misunderstanding, straight up. I want all this to work out. 'CSI' is a part of who I am."

Fox, meanwhile, had been let go a day before Eads because she had apparently missed a deadline to pledge in writing that the pay issue would not affect her turning up for work. The actor said she was "mystified" by her dismissal as she had sent in the letter in time.

Sources told *E! News Live* today that CBS had ruled the incident a "misunderstanding," clearing the way for Fox's return.

CBS has yet to comment.
