By Jessica Ritz in LA Times: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-jorja-fox-csi-interview-20150926-story.html">As 'CSI' comes to a close, actress Jorja Fox is open to an uncertain future</a>
<blockquote>Jorja Fox of "CSI" is preparing to face welcome uncertainty. "I think you kind of have to embrace the unknown if you're an actor," she says.

After playing Las Vegas forensic scientist Sara Sidle on "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" for 15 seasons, Jorja Fox is preparing to face — even welcoming — uncertainty. "I think you kind of have to embrace the unknown if you're an actor," she says. The show that launched the colossal franchise on CBS — as well as career aspirations for forensics obsessives everywhere — concludes Sunday with a two-hour finale.

Fortunately, Fox has other passions, including outdoor exercise and her environmentally conscious vegetarian diet.

**With "CSI" wrapping up after so many years, will you have more time to surf and dedicate to fitness?**

I sure hope so. I've been surfing regularly since we wrapped production. I gave myself a few weeks to decompress and enjoy the end of summer, and I'm already considerably fitter than I was when we shot the finale. I hope I can stay this way.

**What are you most excited about moving on to next?**

I helped produce three documentary films through my company Seafox Productions these last few years, and I'd like to continue making documentaries. It's been a very rewarding experience.

I'm most excited about not knowing what I am going to do next or where I am going to land. I can count the ways I'm not going to miss "CSI" on one hand. I won't miss the early calls, the late nights, the extreme heat, the extreme cold or the plastic vest I've worn for more than 10 years. Other than that, I'm going to miss everything about "CSI," but I've always enjoyed not knowing exactly where the road leads.

**How did you get involved with documentary films?**

About 10 years ago I attended a small dinner party where most of the guests got into a big discussion, which turned into an hourlong argument. I opted to stay out of the heated discussion and began talking with the man sitting next me, who told me all about a film he was making. I knew within the first 10 minutes that I wanted to be a part of his project and asked how I could help. That's how our film, "How I Became an Elephant," began. I love to tell stories, and I love to give others a platform to share their stories.

**How do your passions for surfing and vegetarianism help inform the type of projects you've produced?**

My passion and love for planet Earth and its creatures informs my surfing, my vegetarianism and the documentaries I produce. I love to be outside; I literally grew up in the ocean and am constantly thinking about when I can get back into the water. I have a boundless interest and love for the natural world.

**Do you have any favorite veg-friendly restaurants and food businesses here?**

I love Native Foods and Veggie Grill for a quick meal. As for a sit-down meal, I love Crossroads Kitchen, Sage Bistro, Mohawk Bend, Shojin Vegan Sushi and Vegan Gold and Vegan Glory.</blockquote>
