_CSI_ is back on October 6th, 2021.

21 years, to the day, that _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ hit our screens. I was one-week into my new apartment, just unpacked, and using an El Gato machine to get screen caps. I tried to find a photo of that device, but it was basically a blue, semi-transparent, rounded corner box that I plugged the coaxial cable into, and then ran a _firewire_ cord to my Mac.

By the time _CSI_ ended, I was downloading directly off my DVR.  Now I don't even have a DVR but I can still easily download streaming via my computer. Tech is wild. I didn't even have Wifi when _CSI_ began! Heck, I didn't have DSL for a couple years! Remember dialup? Yep, that's how I used to do all this.

It's very different now, thankfully. And that difference will come back to us with the new series, as _everything_ is different again!

What new things (tech, science, or otherwise) are you looking forward to?

Oh and for the eagle eyes who noticed I had Oct 6th as the date set up earlier, no, no one told me. I just saw it was a Wednesday and thought "It I was the CSI people..." and I was right. I'm not psychic, I'm just a weirdo like Grissom.
