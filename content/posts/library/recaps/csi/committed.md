## Synopsis

Grissom and Sara investigate the murder of a mental-hospital patient and quickly narrow down the suspects to a handful of other patients and staff members.

## Review

Sara is attacked by the main suspect when Grissom walks off and leaves her all alone in the nurse's station. Later, we learn that Sara's mother spent a few months in a psychiatric hospital, and that Sara used to visit her.

In the original script, the scene where Sara is attacked was supposed to show the suspect (Adam) fantasizing about raping her. On the DVD's commentary, Jorja Fox says she was both 'excited and terrified' when she first read that scene.

During the interrogation scene, when the camera pans down Sara, her fingernail is painted gold in a 'shout out' to episode writer Sarah Goldfinger.

## Notes

* Sara's mother spent some time in an institution again after "[Nesting Dolls](/library/recaps/csi/nesting-dolls/)."
* Sara again refuses to leave a case in which she's become personally invested.
