Well gosh, you guys weren't shy about telling me what you wanted!  So fine, you want videos, you've got videos, and there's no reason to wait to get this going.

<strong><a href="https://jorjafox.net/videos">JFO Videos</a></strong> is a YouTube Playlist belonging to the jorjafoxonline youtube account.  These are <strong>NOT</strong> going to be fan-made videos, sorry guys, but it will be a collection of Jorja interviews, excerpts, and other clips of Jorja. Basically, all those clips that you spend hours trying to find on YouTube will be collected into a cohesive place!

If you know of some videos  that should be added, send a message (via youtube) to jorjafoxonline and I'll add it.

That's it!  YouTube will manage the copyright issues.
