I seem to recall saying I'd only post new media when new PEOPLE donated (not when someone made multiple donations).  Well, okay, Shane, you smart ass, using a different account. I know it's you, but you know what, I don't care.  Here you go, with a clip of Connie bringing in bagels instead of donuts.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm craving a bagel!
