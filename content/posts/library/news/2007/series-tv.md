Number one all around the world, CSI is apparently still at the top of its game. One could be forgiven for thinking that after seven seasons and two spin-offs, the genre would have completely lost steam, but that's not taking into account the talent of the writers and the quality of the actors. We went to talk to the team behind the show to find out what they have in store for us in Season seven and how the show has managed to remain as fresh as ever.

A few months ago at the CBS Season seven premiere we were able to meet the CSI team : Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), Gary Dourdan (Warrick), George Eads (Nick), Jorja Fox (Sara), Eric Szmanda (Greg), Robert David Hall (Dr Al Robbins), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Brass), Carol Mendelsohn (Executive Producer) and Naren Shankar (Executive Producer).

"There has been for a very long time hints of some history or special chemistry between Grissom and Sara..."

**JORJA FOX:** Not in the pilot because I wasn't there from the very first episode. Yeah, the character of Sara Sidle was described, in the very brief description given out before the auditions, as Grissom's eventual love interest. There were also a few other strange bits of information, like the fact that she could hold alcohol better than anyone and some mention of sociability problems. I was very intrigued by that and prepared myself for the day the relationship would become reality. Lots of little hints dropped here and there through the series have led up to it. The coolest part if the way the affair is revealed at the end of the season. It was ingenious of the writers, because we see the characters together, but we don't know how long they've been together. It was brilliantly executed. It's going to open up lots of ideas for the characters.

"In what state of mind were you before playing the scene between your character and Grissom?"

**JORJA FOX:** I was very enthusiastic. It's also quite frightening because there is a certain comfort in doing a procedural. One of the most beautiful gifts of this show is that at the end of seven years, there are still as many personal stories to tell about each one. It's rare, after so long, to continue to want to know more about the characters. It's very motivating.

"Did you expect the impassioned reactions of the audience to the relevance of this scene?"

**NAREN SHANKAR:** I don't know if it was a surprise but it was gratifying. When people have such strong feelings, it's a measure of their interest in the show, so it was really very pleasant.

**CAROL MENDELSOHN:** When I came back to work on the new season, I found on my desk a huge pile of letters from fans all around the world. I was told that the viewers were divided, that 60% approved of Sara and Grissom being together and 40% did not. The fans were delighted to see two adults, two professionals who were excellent in their work, find each other and engage in a serious and romantic relationship that isn't sordid... You don't see them tearing at each other's clothes.

**JORJA FOX:** No, that's for next year! (Laughs) Thats why Billy and I have been working out at the gym all summer! (Laughs)

"Since we're on that topic, are there other characters who are together without anyone knowing about it?"

**JORJA FOX:** No, for the moment, at the start of Season seven it's only Grissom and Sara, as our delightful (beautiful) audience knows well. One of the most amusing things about doing a series for such a long time, is that new stories that you haven't ever thought of, crop up. Gary never thought he'd be married, nor did George think he'd spend 48 hours in a box. The writers and producers are very generous. If there is something that we don't want to do or that bothers us, generally, they'll change it. They also invite ideas from us which will really be included in the show. That's cool. We never know how things will go in the years to come, and that's the fun part.
