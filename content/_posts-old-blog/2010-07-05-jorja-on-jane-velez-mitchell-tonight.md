Short notice, but I (literally) just turned my computer on after visiting home for a 90th birthday.  

<blockquote>Tonight Jane Velez-Mitchell will host a one hour show devoted to animal rights. “Jane’s Fight For Animal Rights” will touch on a variety of animal welfare issues such as the impact of the oil spill on animals in the Gulf, the government’s roundup of wild horses, and the movement to fight for basic anti-cruelty protections for factory farm animals. 

Additionally Bob Barker, Pierce Brosnan, and Jorja Fox of CSI will be interviewed regarding their efforts to help animals. 

Organizations featured during the special include In Defense of Animals, Farm Sanctuary, PETA, Sea Shepherd, Humane Society of the United States, Mercy for Animals, and The Cloud Foundation.

“Jane’s Fight For Animal Rights” airs tonight, July 5th, at 7 p.m. ET / 4 p.m. PT on Headline News (HLN).</blockquote>
