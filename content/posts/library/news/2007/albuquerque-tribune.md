For months, we've all known it was coming - the departure of a beloved **"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"** (8 p.m., KRQE News 13) character.

Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) makes her last appearance in tonight's episode, and mostly this makes me sad.

She's an interesting and complex character who truly bonds with people. I like her eccentricities, and while her hair will never be as cute as Catherine's (Marg Helgenberger), she still manages to look good while knee deep in gross stuff.

The only plus I see in her leaving is that I'll no longer be subjected to the stomach-churning romance between Sara and Grissom (William Petersen).

Seriously, the two of them together easily make the list of worst TV couples ever. They're even more disgusting than Wilhemina and Bradford on "Ugly Betty."

Of course, there's always hope that with a little bit of cold, hard cash as an incentive, Sara could reappear, because at least she's not going to die some sort of icky death.

Tonight, freakishly smart Hannah (Juliette Goglia) returns to back up her brother, Marlon (Douglas Smith), on yet another violent crime.

The case leads Sara to question her future as a CSI.

She should have started rethinking her profession during that whole "likely death at the hands of the miniature killer" storyline, but that's just me.

So long, Sara. It's been nice knowing you for eight grisly years.
