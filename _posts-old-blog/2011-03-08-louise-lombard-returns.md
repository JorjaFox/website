So we have Sara (his wife), Julia (his ex), Betty (mom), Lady Heather (ex...something) and now?  Sofia's back!  All we need now is Teri Miller and Dr. Gilbert.

<blockquote>The return of serial killer Nate Haskell isn’t _all_ bad for the Vegas crimefighters of _CSI_. Rather, his latest reign of terror will actually set the stage for the return of former series regular Louise Lombard!

TVLine has learned exclusively that the _CSI_ alumna will reprise her role as the well-liked Sofia Curtis during May sweeps — and one major thing has changed since we last saw her back in Season 8.

“Sofia’s a deputy chief now,” executive producer Carol Mendelsohn reveals. “She’s gotten her shield and she has a real ‘take no prisoners’ attitude.”
As such, when Sofia gets introduced to Langston (Laurence Fishburne), things do not go smoothly.</blockquote>
