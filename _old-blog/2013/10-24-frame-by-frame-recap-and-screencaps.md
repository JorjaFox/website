Anyone remember what episode 100 was? Ch-ch-changes. That was the last 'milestone' episode we celebrated on CSI. Well, we here at JFO. I suppose we _kinda_ did Living Legend, but both were 3-star episodes for Sara.

This was not that.

While it was only four stars, it was so very close to five that had we had but one tidbit of Sara Backstory, it would have jumped over. This was Sara's case. I was worried that having Marg around would pull that away, but no, not at all.

</ul>
This final scene had me curious, though. I mean, I expected the shorts of "Dead Doll" and "Living Doll." I knew they were going to throw in some clips, but this was not expected.

Interesting way to talk about Grissom without talking about Grissom.
