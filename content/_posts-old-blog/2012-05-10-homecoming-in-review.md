<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/homecoming-in-review/sandwich/" rel="attachment wp-att-4633"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4633" title="Sara Eating a Sandwhich" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/05/sandwich-230x153.jpg" alt="Jorja has a way of eating sandwiches that makes you think of … eating sandwiches" width="230" height="153" /></a>Two stars for Sara, first of all.

I enjoyed the episode. The cliffhangers were as I expected, so that didn't shock me and I knew the kid would be kidnapped. It's the rules of TV. If you show a cute kid in the first act, she'll be dead or kidnapped in the last. (See also: If you cast a well-known actor as a guest on Law &amp; Order, they're the killer.)

Compared to last week, though, it's a let down in a way. I mean, we know George Eads signed on for next year already, so Nick may quit, but he'll be back in some form.

And that's it for Season 12!

Oh, well there was the review by EW which said:
<blockquote>In general, <em>CSI</em> has become a richer series. It’s minimized the crazy-Vegas murder scenarios that were beginning to undermine minimal believability, and I’d say that even if you wish that, say, Jorja Fox’s Sara had more of a role in the show these days, that reflects the way things happen in any given workplace — some veterans tend to recede into the background, content to do their jobs well, while new faces (Shue’s Finn, in this case) come on like gangbusters, eager (or neurotic, or insecure, or all of the above) to prove themselves. This is where the realism of <em>CSI</em> now resides.</blockquote>
