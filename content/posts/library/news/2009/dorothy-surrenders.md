I know it's not particularly cool to say, but I love 'CSI.' The we are the original, accept no substitute, high stakes or go home 'CSI.' The we don't need a stinking city behind our initials because what happens here stays here 'CSI.' The we aren't about making bad puns while taking off our sunglasses or tinting everything in NYPD's blue 'CSI.' You know -- Vegas, baby. It's just solid TV. Is it groundbreaking? Not especially. But week after week it is well done, infrequently gimmicky and beautifully produced. Tell me some of the scenes, especially in the last few Grissom seasons, did not feel cinematic in scope.

What I have always particularly liked about crime show and procedurals is that the women in them are not superfluous. They work just as hard and are taken just as seriously as the men. And that's important. They also aren't constrained as tightly by the shackles of glamour. Are they glamorous and attractive? Duh, they're actors. But they don't need to show up in evening gowns or leather hot pants or six-inch heels. They can just show up and be competent. (Well, except when doing magazine photoshoots, but one victory at a time, people.) Which, in turn, leads me to the two founding females of CSI: Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox.

While there may not have been a lot of warmth between their characters when the show premiered 10 years ago, what has developed is an organic affection and genuine respect. Like something you might find at an actual workplace between colleagues who have known each other for a decade. And, in the naughty recesses of my brain, I like to think that it's Sara and Catherine, not Sara and Grissom, that indulge in after-hours extracurriculars together. Now, I'm no GSR hater. I don't necessarily want to watch them together in silk robes, but I'm happy their characters seem to have found a happily ever after -- and even made it official. But, come on, look at the opportunity the producers are missing here.

But now with Sara's return for several episodes this season, they have can finally make amends. And the ladies are even teasing us about it via their new TV Guide cover story:

:**Would Catherine ever kiss Sara?**
:**Jorja:** We did today! At the TV Guide Magazine photo shoot.

Of course, the show already missed an equally golden opportunity when Det. Sofia Curtis (Louise Lombard, a.k.a. The Best-Strutting Butch With a Button-Down and a Badge Possibly Ever) mysteriously left the show. I mean, "ohmygodhowfuckinghotaretheytogether"?

And while I had hoped for some sort of Sara Sidle/Soup Chef chemistry this year, Lauren Lee Smith's character Riley is gone before the season premieres tonight. Riley wasn't my favorite anyway, not because of Lauren but because her character wasn't given much to work with. So tonight, I'm going to celebrate the return of Sara, if only for a little while, to my favorite crime procedural. Plus, there has always been an unspoken agreement in the community that Jorja is one of ours.

So welcome back to my TV, homegirl. We've missed that gap-tooth grin. Now go get the bad guys.
