<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9386" alt="Lion Ark" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/11/vlcsnap-00014.jpg" width="300" height="168" />The public's reaction to Lion Ark has been phenomenal, to the point that I heard winds of an Oscar nomination. It's certainly qualified to win one in the documentary category. Only time, and the capriciousness of the voters, will tell us for sure.

The video embedded via Facebook has two little bits of Jorja. The first one is from Mill Valley, the second is from HIFF.
