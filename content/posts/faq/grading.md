Grading is our subjective way of rating a TV show or movie by way of how much is Jorja Fox's character involved, and how much screen time does she get.

The goal is to give the highest 'score' to anything that someone should watch if looking for a great representation of Jorja Fox's work as an actor. This is not an attempt to grade how good a movie or TV show is. In fact, _Memento_ is a highly acclaimed movie and only has a 'score' of 2, because Jorja Fox's role is quite minor. Rating also may not reflect how much screen time Jorja has. For example, in the _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode A La Cart, she's in three scenes, however a great deal of characterization is developed in those scenes.

Grades are given on a loose scale of 0 to 5 stars, with a rough guideline as follows:

### Red Stars

{{< star color="red-star" count="5">}} - Has not been viewed.

Example: Anything that has not yet aired or been seen.

### 0 Gold Stars

{{< star color="grey-star" count="5" >}} - Credited but does not appear.

Example: The _[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation](/library/actor/csi/)_ episode "[Pilot](/library/recaps/csi/pilot/)".

### 1 Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" count="1" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" count="4" >}} - Very brief scene or two, no more than 2 minutes total. Often as a guest actor.

Example: The _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode "High and Low" or the movie "[The Jerky Boys](/library/actor/jerky-boys)".

### 2 Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" count="2" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" count="3" >}} - Some dialogue, acting as a supporting character.

Example: The movie "[Memento](/library/actor/memento/)" or the _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode "Burked".

### 3 Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" count="3" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" count="2" >}} - Multiple scenes of varying degrees of importance, not the main character, but carries a subplot. On camera for a third of the running time and/or some new information about her character is revealed.

Example: The movie [Velocity Trap](/library/actor/velocity-trap/) or the _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode "Friends and Lovers".

### 4 Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" count="4" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" count="1" >}} - One of the primary characters, but not necessarily the main character. Her character likely has noticeable development and information about her character is revealed.

Example: The _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episodes "Snuff" or "Gum Drops", or the movie [Food for the Heart](/library/actor/food-for-the-heart/).

### 5 Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" count="5" >}} - The main character and/or is central to the plot, or if her character has significant development. If you want to watch a movie/episode for Jorja, this is the one.

Example: The _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episodes "Empty Eyes", "Nesting Dolls", Committed", "Living Doll."
