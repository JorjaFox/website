## Synopsis

A young boy goes missing from his backyard, which Bobby works on. Johnny looks into a husband gone missing, and Connie works on a wife who vanished after shopping. In all three cases, the families declare that there's nothing unsavory about their missing loved ones or themselves.

## Review

Connie brings in bagels instead of donuts, causing complaints from some of the other cops who aren't as pleased about the health kick.

For the second episode in a row, Connie gets her own case, this time of a wife who never came home after going out for groceries, shortly after having a fight with her husband. Ray tells her to mark it up as voluntary, mere moments after chiding Johnny for making gross assumptions about *his* case, a point that Connie brings up. In gushing over the contents of the wife's closet, Connie determines she took neither her wallet nor keys, so she grills the husband about the fight. Asking the friends, Connie finds out that Charlene was supposed to contact her best friend in the morning, after being loaned $100, but she never did. Also, Charlene had cheated on her ex, and her husband John was always worried and jealous about that fact.

Ray is still dismissive of Connie needing to do any work on the case, but she follows up and finds the car was used in the robbery of a convenience store the night before. The car has blood in it and has clearly been shot. The cops at the robbery thing Charlene was shot by the robber and carjacked. Since Connie has details about the woman, she fires up a search order in the area. They find Charlene, after Connie bullies the search patrol into keeping trying, and she's alive, but badly injured.

## Quotes

**Connie:** I can see her lying to her friends, but why would she lie to me?\
**Ray:** You're a cop, Connie. People don't talk to cops, people lie to cops.
