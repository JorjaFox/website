For those of you who like that sort of thing.

In the gallery, I've removed watermarks from all files that they were not hard coded onto. I'm also doing my best to upgrade some of the older screencaps to higher quality, and as I do so, I am weeding out the old watermarks.

Finally, due to changes in Gallery (the code), I've taken down fan art. It's all saved on my hard drive (mostly because I dig it all), but since it's hard to maintain, and we're not really a community driven site, AND you all seem adept at flickr sorts of sites, it was a logical move.  As for pimping your art, for now come on over to the forum and post. I'll see about some sort of way you can just slap up links without opening up the site to spammers.
