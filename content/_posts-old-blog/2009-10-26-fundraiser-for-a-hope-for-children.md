AHOPE (also known as A Hope for Children) strives to support services in Ethiopian for children, specifically orphans who are infected with HIV/AIDS.  Ethiopia was hit hard by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and a good portion of an entire generation was devastated by the disease, leaving hundreds of thousands of children orphans, the majority of whom test positive for HIV.  Making matters worse, due to widespread misinformation, fear and superstition, these children are abandoned by what families they might have had and are left to die alone.

Past just providing orphan care (which AHOPE does with two childrenâ€™s homes exclusively for the care of those infected with HIV), they strive to educate and reunite families, to find homes for these children and provide long term assistance.  But they can only do so much.

Starting <strong>November 2nd, 2009</strong>, JFO and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround">JAA</a> will be joining forces to help raise money for AHOPE.

If you're interested in helping out, a couple volunteers are needed on our end, so please <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/605871.html">contact the JAA admin</a>.
