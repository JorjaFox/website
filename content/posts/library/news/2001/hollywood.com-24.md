Actress Jorja Fox has been everywhere on the tube-from a three-season stint on *ER* to a guest role on *The West Wing*-but she's found a home on CBS' critically acclaimed series *C.S.I.*, playing forensics expert Sara Sidle.
Fox, 33, spoke with Hollywood.com over the phone from her L.A. home to discuss her role on *C.S.I.*, the upcoming Emmys ceremony, the success of *ER* and the joys of nudity.

**Jorja, you're a busy girl these days. Thanks for taking some time off from that grueling damn schedule of yours to talk with us.**

**Fox**: Hey, I love these phone interviews. They're so much more stream-of-consciousness, ya know?

**And more laid back.**

**Fox**: Oh yeah. I could be half naked right now.

**Yeah, me too. Well, that aside, tell me how early production's going on the show.**

**Fox**: Great! I'm really excited. It's good to be back.

**Does the show seem to be going in any different directions this season?**

**Fox**: They've only shown me one script, so I'm not sure yet. But the first episode is great. There's a big plot twist in there.

**Last season, your character, Sara, played a fairly supporting role on the show. Is she going to break out a bit more this season as a major player?**

**Fox**: [Sighs] I don't even know. I hope so. But everything's a secret right now, so....

**Well, one main character, Marg [Helgenberger], certainly received some recognition this year, snagging an Emmy nomination for best lead actress. What do you think of her chances?**

**Fox**: Oh, we're all pretty giddy, that's for sure. She deserves it. The show got three nominations, I believe. I think one was a tech nomination.

**Regardless of whether or not you guys win, it's still a damn good reason to get dressed up and schmooze.**

**Fox**: Yeah, and it's good that Marg got the nomination because she's definitely the best dresser of anyone on the show. Me-I'm more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl, ya know? Both me and George] [Eads, who plays Nick Stokes on the show] are like that. Man, we tie for last place in the best-dressed department.

**One show you used to work on, *ER*, got a handful of nominations as well. Do you think the show is better or worse since you left in '99?**

**Fox**: I disagree with people who put down the show today. I mean, it's the number-one show on TV, ya know? It has been for years. That's such a challenge to stay on top, and they've done it every time. It's still a great show.

**Ever miss it?**

**Fox**: Sometimes. But on *C.S.I.*, the atmosphere's not so different, ya know what I mean? The sets still have that metallic look. The labs and everything.

**Very true. It's not such a departure after all. And *C.S.I.*&#8216;s amassing quite a fan base, I hear.**

**Fox**: Oh, god yes. These fans are amazing. The show's really developed a following with students-you know, forensic students. They've really latched on.

**I guess most people still recognize you for *ER*, but you recently made an appearance in one of the year's best films, *Memento*. Any further big-screen plans? **

**Fox**: That was fun, definitely. I love movies. There may be a project coming up with Josh Leonard-you know, the guy from *The Blair Witch Project*? A short film. But right now it's *C.S.I.* all the way.
