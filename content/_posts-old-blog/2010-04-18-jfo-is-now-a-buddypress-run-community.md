<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/buddypress.png"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/buddypress-100x100.png" alt="" title="buddypress" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2362" /></a> <a href="http://buddypress.org">BuddyPress</a> is a Social Networking plugin for WordPress which allows people to (among other things) send private messages, keep track of comments, post directly to other people, mention them in comments, get email notifications and more!

So what does this mean?

Well, the JFO community is growing. You guys want to talk to each other in more ways than just replying to comments.  And you want more from the site!  People have been wistfully telling me things like "I wish JFO had features like Ning!"  So I sat down this month and pounded away at the site.  Don't worry, everything is all run by JFO on JFO and for JFO.  There's no partnership with another site or some extra sign up.  If you want to edit your profile or show up on the users lists, why, just log in!

BuddyPress is one of those hugely powerful things, and it's actually something I wanted to bring in to JFO last year, but I had to wait until WordPress 3.0 before I could tweak the main site how I wanted enough that it would work. Right now it's just set up with enough to get people started. Check out <a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/">The Community Blog</a> to see what's available!
