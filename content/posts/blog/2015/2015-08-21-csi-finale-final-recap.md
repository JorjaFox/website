Last night's ET segment on CSI was pulled. No one knows why. It's a a crime to investigate! Maybe it was because filming isn't done yet? Or they gave it all away...

Either way, it's all done now.

By the way, if you've missed any photos, they're all up at the [CSI Season 16 Candid Gallery](https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/pub/s16/candid/) so please, peruse.

I bet that's Heather's necklace. Looks like her style.

Boats? What does the harbor have anything to do with this? Hmmm.

CBS posted [6 Things You Should Never Say To A CSI Fan](http://www.cbs.com/shows/csi/news/sme/181/6-things-you-should-never-say-to-a-csi-crime-scene-investigation-fan/) and this was #3:

A few hours left. By the time you read this post, it's all over. There's no more CSI to be filmed.

We know how you feel, Liz. We don't want to say goodbye either.

But all things must come to an end, good or bad.

I want to thank the cast and crew of CSI for sharing all these moments with us. You made the farewell more poignant but hurt less by letting us see the end. We have one more strange trip with you, the airing of the episode, and then. Then we say goodbye to this chapter of our lives.

Thank you everyone reading this.
