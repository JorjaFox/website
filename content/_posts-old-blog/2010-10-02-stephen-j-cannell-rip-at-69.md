Cannell, who came up with <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Missing_Persons">Missing Persons</a> passed away on October first as well.  If you want to watch the show, you can pick up the "Prime Time Crime: Stephen J. Cannell Collection" DVD box set. And yes, that high pitched voice is Jorja!

I think it's pretty safe to say that without that first, albiet failed, series under her belt, we may never have gotten to know Jorja on <em>ER</em>, <em>The West Wing</em> or <em>CSI</em>
