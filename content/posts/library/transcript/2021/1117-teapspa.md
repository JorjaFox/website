**Kim Matula:** And now a special message from Jorja Fox. She's a star of _The West Wing_, _ER_, and is known to over 73 million viewers around the world as Sara Sidle on _CSI_. She's just finished filming _CSI: Vegas_ and she is an ADI Ambassador who has backed this bill since it's inception. Jorja Fox.

**Jorja Fox:** Thanks, Kim. I am so pleased to be a part of this today. You know, some people think that circuses are educational, when in fact all they do is teach people how _not_ to treat animals. They set a terrible example that it's okay to keep animals in cages and on chains, and deprive them from a natural life of social interaction, of enrichment, of families, of sustainable habitats.

Please support this important bill. These animals deserve our respect, and our compassion.
