Blame LiveJournal.  I was planning on doing this in another 6 months, but they decided to end Free User Accounts.  For new users.  Signs of what is yet to come, I decided to go now before I had to gnash teeth.  We're back on Wordpress, with a new DB so no one's user ids exist, and comments are turned off for now.  We'll work on that.
