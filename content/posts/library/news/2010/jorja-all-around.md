**JAA:** How long have you been working as a stunt-woman?

**CM:** I've been a working stunt-woman for about 10 years but got in the business over 15 years ago. Working is the key word!

**JAA: **What was the most terrifying or difficult stunt you've ever had to perform?

**CM: **Hmmmmm I always get asked this question and really it's not ever terrifying as it is an incredible [adrenaline] rush .... Difficult? Well sometimes [it] all can be difficult as you want to make sure you give the coordinator what they want and [also give it] 100%... I must say ... this will sound funny, BUT on an episode of *CSI*... I think a few seasons back I was playing a passenger on a community bus and I was sitting in the very back while they were shooting. We drove up and down and around North Hollywood for several hours and I got REALLY bad motion sickness! Now the motion sickness, yes, was the problem BUT not letting the crew and stunt coordinator know how bad it really was [because] I was a stunt-woman ... [I] had to be tough and getting motion sickness on a bus was not so tough! I really wanted to throw up but truly held it in [until] we finally got off and was able to get some soda water! THAT was the most terrifying/difficult job so far... not letting anyone know how bad it was! HA HA.

**JAA:** We've seen you before on* CSI* in the episode *The Gone Dead Train* in season nine. You got in a pretty nasty bite on Catherine **(Marg Helgenberger)**! Was it fun to tangle with Marg?

**CM: **She was so amazing and sweet! She was tough and a real trooper when I had to throw her around and attack her!

**JAA: **You've now gone at both of *CSI*'s leading ladies! Who else would you like to take a swing at?

**CM:** I [would] rather they swing at me! And anyone who wants to!

**JAA: **As far as stunts go, was setting up your scene with Marg Helgenberger in season nine relatively simple? Did you give Marg any sort of direction from your background of fighting expertise?

**CM: **That's all done with the Stunt Coordinator! I just make sure she [is] comfortable with the action I'm told to do.

**JAA:** We saw you take a pretty hard punch from Sara Sidle **(Jorja Fox) **in the *CSI* season eleven premiere! How much preparation went into setting up the scene?

**CM: **Again that's all set up by the Stunt Coordinator. Doing that shot with Jorja Fox took a few rehearsals but she was such a professional and a quick learner [that] it didn't take much time at all. She was having a blast!

**JAA:** What was it like to work with Jorja Fox? Did you both have fun going at each other?

**CM: **I must say [*CSI *is] one of the best sets to work on. EVERYONE is very friendly and fun! Jorja Fox was very friendly and so fun......she's a sweetie!

**JAA: **Any fun experiences while working on the *CSI* set?

**CM: **This will sound stupid...BUT really every experience I have on *CSI* is fun!

**JAA:** You have an extensive background working as a stunt-woman on various television and film sets. What is it like to see yourself in these roles?

**CM:** Hate it!

**JAA:** Will we see more of you this season?

**CM:** [In] episode 3 I'm doubling the legendary "ANN MARGRET" [and] got to do some fun stunts and meet her! She is awesome and that's when I feel fortunate with the job I [have]! I think the episode is called "SQWEEGEL" [or] something like that. I'm sure you'll find it!
