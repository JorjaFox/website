Yeah, well, let's just say that some digging through microfiche pays off.

From 1997, I've got an old issue of <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/The_Advocate_%2818_March_1997%29">The Advocate</a>, published just a few days after Maggie Doyle became only the 24th openly gay character on prime time:
<blockquote>**<em>ER</em> gets a lesbian**

**P**rime-time TV just got it's 24th gay character. <em>ER</em>'s Dr. Maggie Doyle, played by **Jorja Fox**, came out to fellow first-year resident, Dr. John Carter, played by **Noah Wyle**, on the February 6 episode of the hit NBC drama.  To coproducer Dr. Neal Baer, who wrote the script, Maggie's lesbian revelation is no big deal.  "We also found out that she's a vegetarian in that episode and that she collects guns," Baer told The Buzz.  "There are all kinds of stereotypes. I wanted to make sure this person doesn't fit into any box."  Nor will Maggie lead with her lesbianism, says Baer.  "We're going to play her as a doctor who happens to be a lesbian.  If it comes up, it comes up, just like in real life.  Maybe someday there'll be a patient who says 'I don't want her touching me.'  That would be an interesting story, because that happens.</blockquote>

Back in 2003, Jorja was a spokesperson for the annual Komen Los Angeles County Race for the Cure, and the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Los_Angeles_Magazine_%28October_2003%29">Los Angeles Magazine</a> had a short article on her work:
<blockquote>Remembering her own experiences as the loved one of a cancer victim, Fox is enthusiastic about what funds raised at the Race can accomplish.  "The Komen Foundation has a tremendous amount of empathy, wisdom and guidance to offer people," says Fox.  "They're an incredible resource."</blockquote>
