<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3965" title="Circus Tent" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/11/3_circus_tent_8x12-210x140.jpeg" alt="Circus Tent" width="100" height="75" />Tomorrow, a ground breaking law on animal circuses will be launched.  If I understand correctly, it won't be going into affect then, but the initiative is being started, and yes, that's why Jorja's going to be in DC.  She and Bob Barker will be running the press conference too.

This is a big deal.
