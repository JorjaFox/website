'CSI' SOAP OPERA: When "CSI" regulars George Eads and Jorja Fox tried to hold out for more money and failed to report for work last week, CBS abruptly fired them for breach of contract. Moonves isn't exactly shedding tears. "It's time to realize a contract is a contract," he said. "When somebody doesn't show up for work, that tells us that, OK, they don't want to work for us anymore. That's our attitude." Though CBS is supposedly looking for actors to replace them, Moonves admitted to fears that the firings might harm the show. "We like those actors, they're very good people," said a more conciliatory Moonves, leading to speculation that CBS might reconsider rehiring them.
