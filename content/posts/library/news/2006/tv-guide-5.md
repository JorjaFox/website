**Question:** Some *CSI* forums are saying you're completely full of it because you said you were 99 percent sure there would be no Grissom-Sara stuff in the season finale. But there are spoilers floating around that say there will be. What's really going on? Your reputation is on the line here! - Jamie< **Ausiello:** I've read those spoilers, too, and all I can say is thank god I didn't say I was *100* percent certain. Here's the deal: My trusty *CSI* mole . who has never steered me wrong before . told me two weeks ago that there would be no Sara-Grissom action in the May 18 finale. But last week, while I was interviewing fellow Sexiest Vegetarian nominee **Jorja Fox**, she hinted that something *may* in fact be happening. "I can't give anything away, but we have a cliff-hanger at the end of this season that I think you guys are going to have a *field* day with," she teased. "All I can say is it's going to be good. It's going to come completely out of left field. I think everyone's going to end Season 6 with their jaws dropped." Fox went on to say that there will be "two cliff-hangers in the finale," one of which involves \***** and the other... Sara-Grissom? "I don't kiss and tell," Fox said. Short-story-short: Either my *CSI* mole lied to me or producers saw my spoiler rant on *Square Off* and decided to tack on some Sara-Grissom stuff at the last minute in my honor. I guess we'll find out on May 18.
