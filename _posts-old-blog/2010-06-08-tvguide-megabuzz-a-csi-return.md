TVGuide.com's Mega Buzz was posted an tells us what we already knew:

<blockquote>**Is Sara Sidle coming back next season on _CSI_? — _Bill_**
**ADAM:** There will definitely be some cast changes, as several of the show's stars, Jorja Fox included, negotiate new contracts. But executive producer Carol Mendelsohn is hoping that Fox will return. "I know what our creative plans are for Sara Sidle, but Jorja and I have not sat down to really talk about next season," she says. "It's really, truly up in the air."
