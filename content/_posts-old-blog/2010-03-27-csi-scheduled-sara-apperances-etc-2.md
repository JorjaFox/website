<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/03/schedule-change.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/03/schedule-change-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="schedule-change" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2329" /></a> So you heard what I did back in January. <a href="https://jorjafox.net/blog/2010/01/19/jorja-is-a-lock-for-the-second-half-of-the-season/">Carol Mendelsohn saying "Jorja will be with us for the whole second half of the season."</a>

And then you found out Jorja's NOT in the April 1st episode ("The Panty Sniffer").  Nor will she be in the April 15th episode ("Field Mice").  Truth but sad.

Then someone may have mentioned that <em>CSI'</em>s April 1st ep will air at 10pm ET and not the normal 9pm.  Again, this is true.

Oh and maybe you heard the rumors that <em>CSI</em>'s moving to Sunday? That one's just <strong>speculation</strong>, it's not a fact or even something CBS is talking about.

So first, don't get all fired up about <em>CSI</em> moving to Sunday. Of course it's possible, but right now that's just a rumor.  And <em>CSI</em> moving, permanently, to 10pm?  Actually, I'd pay attention to that one.  It wouldn't be a surprise at all to me, and it would make sense.  <em>CSI</em>'s going back to it's procedural roots, and it's not going to gain on the one-two punch of <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> and <em>Private Practice</em>.  <em>The Mentalist</em>, on the other hand, is as much about the personal reasons for investigating crimes as it is about crimes.

Now all that is MY speculation, of course. I work in computers, not the 'biz' and I am, in no way at all, a Hollywood insider.  If I hear anything certain about the Sunday thing, I'll post. And as for the possibility of a permanent move to 10pm? We won't know probably until the Monday AFTER the April 1st episode.

I am certain of this: The move to 10pm is currently <strong>temporary</strong>, but it is a test to see how well a new episode of <em>The Mentalist</em> does at 9pm. If it beats <em>CSI</em>'s ratings, then we may very well see a move.  It not, then everything will stay as it does.  But I'd sure keep this in my mind as a serious possibility.
