## Synopsis

Sara, Morgan, and Finn are attending a CSI conference in town and go the hotel early to enjoy mimosas, a spa treatment, and relaxation before getting down to work. While there, they see Jane Snyder. Sara does not want to see Jane, but alas the woman is excited to see her old friend. On the other hand, Finn runs into an old friend with whom she regularly hooks up at conventions. During 'Dr. Jane's' presentation, which includes dancing go-go men, a single shooter with an AR-16 blasts the room, killing multiple people.

Meanwhile, the boys back at the lab are working the case of a liquified body of a security guard who just so happens to work at the hotel where the conference is taking place. The dead guard's key card was used recently, putting the attendees in danger, as the shooter, Jeff Lasky, had the card. Lasky is shot and killed by SWAT in the hotel. Lasky was after Dr. Jane, the expert witness who previously kept the man who eventually killed his family out of jail.

After the scene is cleared, the CSIs find a second killer who is targeting, among other people, Sara.

## Review

Sara and Jane were criminalists in San Francisco before Jane switched teams to become an expert defense witness. Jane skewered one of Sara's trainees on the stand, engendering animosity between the two. During the shooting, Sara keeps her sanity and spots the shooter and his gun. She also refuses to evacuate, staying on site to help process the scene since the hotel is on lockdown

## Notes

* _Crime Time in Primetime_ may be a shoutout to _Women Of Primetime Crime_, a show Jorja was on representing CSI back in in 2001.
* Sara still believes in love and 'the one' (though possibly not marriage).
* Sara spots the rifle and knows it by site.
* Sara helps Morgan clean the blood off her hands after the case is closed.

## Quotes

**Sara:** But ... then you never get the chance to make a real connection. I mean to be with somebody who really gets you, who loves you for who you are, I don't know... I think it's worth the risk.
