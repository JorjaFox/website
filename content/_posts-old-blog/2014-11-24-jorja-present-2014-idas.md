The <a href="http://www.documentary.org/awards2014">2014 International Documentary Association Awards</a> will be held Dec. 5 at the Paramount Theater at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, and Jorja is planned to be presenting. Comic and writer Carol Leifer will host the 30th IDA Awards.

Tickets are $250 for non-members ($225 tax deductible), but... <em>Dress code is cocktail attire.</em> Me and my jeans will be nicely comfy at home. If you want to attend, you can <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/ida-documentary-awards-2014-tickets-13267444283">buy tickets here</a> (Eventbrite). Not going either?

Some photos are likely to come from this, but they don't seem to be picked up by the larger sites.
