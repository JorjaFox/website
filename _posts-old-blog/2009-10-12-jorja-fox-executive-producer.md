**Rattle the Cage Productions** is a video production group who raises awareness about animal and environmental protection issues.

As this is a matter close to Jorja's heart, who can be surprised to find out that she's volunteering?

<blockquote>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit TV show CSI, is commited to helping animals and wildlife and is a big supporter of Rattle the Cage. As executive producer on our new documentary series, BLACK MARKET: inside the endangered species trade Jorja feels we can enlighten, educate, and eventually eradicate the crimes against nature in Asia's jungles. </blockquote>

This work is <em>not completed</em>, so it's not certain exactly what everyone's role/involvement will be.  As with all things, it may not happen, but either way, it's nice to see Jorja still slogging away for the world.
