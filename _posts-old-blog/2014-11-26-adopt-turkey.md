It's Thanksgiving in the US and a lot of us are spending time with family or traveling (good look folks going to the east!). Some people are vegetarians and have the pain of going to see family who eat turkey. Some people volunteer for people who don't have families and feed them. Some people work so those with family events can enjoy them.

Whatever you're doing, be good, be safe, and consider <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/giving/adopt-a-turkey/">adopting a turkey</a>!
<blockquote>Since 1986, Farm Sanctuaryâ€™s _Adopt a Turkey Project_ has encouraged people to save a turkey at Thanksgiving through sponsorships that help us rescue animals and provide care for them at our sanctuaries, as well as educate and advocate for turkeys and other farm animals everywhere.

For a one-time donation gift of just $30, anyone can sponsor a turkey. As a turkey sponsor,<a href="http://action.farmsanctuary.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12520&amp;12520.donation=form1" target="_blank"> you will receive a special _Adopt a Turkey_ certificate with a color photo of and fun details about your new friend</a>.

Turkey sponsorships also make perfect gifts, so make an even greater impact this holiday season by sharing the love with others. For a gift of $210, you can sponsor the whole flock and have adoption certificates sent to family and friends!</blockquote>
You can adopt a turkey from the Farm Sanctuary for $30 USD (long term JFO folks remember this as being Animal Acres). It's a gift that reminds us that those who need advocacy are those without a voice.

And if you need some vegetarian recipes, it's not too late! Grab the <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Thanksgiving-Handout-v3.pdf">Thanksgiving Handout</a>.
