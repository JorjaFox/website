<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/advocacy/20060000-peta/"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3422" title="sexyveg" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/sexyveg-100x100.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>It's that time of year again!  Jorja is up for the Sexiest Vegetarian and we should all vote.  Jorja's never actually won this thing.  You guys think we can change that? The first round of voting is open, and you can vote <a href="http://features.peta.org/sexiest-Vegetarian-Celebrities-2011/default.aspx">on their website via Twitter</a> or just tweet this:
<blockquote>I voted for Jorja Fox for #sexyvegceleb! Vote here: http://bit.ly/jYwm6p</blockquote>
Don't have Twitter?  Don't worry!  <a href="http://features.peta.org/sexiest-Vegetarian-Celebrities-2011/Vote.aspx">You can vote old school style too</a>!

By the way. PETA is wrong. @TheJorjaFox is **NOT** Jorja.  That account was the one who was faking being Jorja at the same time I was talking to her people about meeting her in Chicago.  Trust me on that on.  Anyway, if you chose to vote via their website, they'll auto-populate her as <em>@TheJorjaFox</em> so you'll need to edit that for them to 'Jorja Fox.'  Yes, I let them know.
