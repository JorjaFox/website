<blockquote>CSI 11.13 is called: “The Two Mrs. Grissoms”</blockquote>

And that's ALL we know right now. I'm gonna take a wild guess and predict Sara's featured heavily in this one, though.

So does Gil have two wives or do you think we meet his mom?

UPDATE! Thank you CSI Mole from MaMa!
<blockquote>CSI 11.13 "The Two Mrs. Grissoms"

Sara clashes with her mother-in-law and a woman from Gil's past when the CSIs investigate a car bombing tied to the faculty and students at a local college's Department of Deaf Cultural Studies...

Mrs. Grissom: This former librarian is Gil Grissom's formidable mother who has a somewhat awkward relationship with Sara. Mrs. Grissom seems to prefer Gil's ex, Ms. Nichols, over Sara, and she's taken aback when Sara goes after Ms. Nichols in a murder case. However, the "two Mrs. Grissoms" come to see eye-to-eye as the case progresses</blockquote>
