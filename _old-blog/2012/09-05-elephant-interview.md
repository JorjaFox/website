It's an elephant kind of day!

Hudson Valley Good Stuff snagged Jorja for an interview about "How I Became an Elephant" at the Kingston Film Festival.
<blockquote>"I adore elephants for so many different reasons--their gentleness, intelligence. They are vegetarians. Like all of the really large land mammals, their habitats are in some of the most peril.   They are a great subject because what’s going on with them is so criticial, so immediate. Elephants just have a grace and dignity to them."</blockquote>
