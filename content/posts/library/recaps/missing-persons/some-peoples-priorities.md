## Synopsis

Bobby's case of a missing dental student who apparently fell into voodoo returns when the parents decide they do want to find their wayward daughter, but she may be a victim of a serial killer. Connie looks into the case of a missing Indian woman who has been missing nine days. Johnny has a Tender Age case of an eleven year-old who went missing from a double-parked car in Lincoln Park.

## Review

Connie's case is of a missing Indian immigrant, Randa Punjabi. The husband, Mr. Najami, and children are concerned, but they claim there was no fight. He waited nine days because he didn't want to alarm the children. The couple have different last names, and Connie finds no woman's clothes in the closet. The husband explains that his wife was very progressive, and that it was her idea to learn jewelry making and move to the US. In the bathroom, Connie takes notes of the vast array of medicine and learns Mr. Najami is sick with leukemia, but refused to be hospitalized, telling the doctor that his wife was dead and he couldn't leave his children alone.

When Mr. Najami refuses to let Connie talk to his children, or tell her the truth, she explains that she will have his sons taken away. He admits his name is Rajiv Bat, and his wife wanted custody in the divorce so he ran away with his boys. His wife filled a warrant for his arrest, so he changed his name. Once he learned he was dying, he decided to have Missing Persons find his wife so Randa could take the boys. Ray orders Connie to have the man arrested and the children sent to DCFS, but the man rabbits. The next day he starts to call Missing Persons every hour to see if they've found her, prompting Connie to man the phones and track Randa down to a restaurant in Chicago. Rajiv confesses to his children the truth, and returns his children to their mother.

Meanwhile, Connie's had flower deliveries every day for three days. At first she claims they're from her husband, who is apologizing for a fight. The second day, her coworkers speculate on if her husband or Connie is having an affair. Finally, on the third day, Connie tells Ray she's divorced, after Ray's wife called her, concerned.

## Quotes

**Connie:** I can find my own dates, Ma. ... Yeah, he was very nice, he just wasn't my type. For starters, he flossed his teeth at the table. ... I'm not gonna end up some sort of 'old maid' just because I'm divorced. ... You sound like dad.
