NEW YORK (AP) - Jorja Fox is waving goodbye to "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."

Fox, 39, tells EW.com she has quit the Las Vegas-based forensics drama, saying she wants to explore other opportunities.

"There are all these things I want to do," she said in a story posted Monday on the Web site. "Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old."

Fox has wrapped up filming on the hit CBS series, and will make her last appearance as Sara Sidle in an episode to air next month, according to the Web site.

CBS publicist Kate Fisher had no comment Tuesday.

Fox's run on "CSI" nearly ended in 2004 when she and co-star George Eads were fired during tense contract negotiations. They were later hired back.

"If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course," said Fox, whose contract expired in May. "But I feel like it's going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by, I have to get off the ride for a while."

Fox has been a cast member since "CSI" premiered in 2000.

CBS is a unit of CBS Corp.
