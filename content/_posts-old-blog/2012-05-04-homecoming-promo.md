<blockquote>Greg walks in and announces ‘We need to have a family meeting’. Then they are all in a room together and he says ‘It’s Jeffrey McKeen’ and Nick says ‘You gotta be kidding me.’ Jules asks who he is and Nick says ‘He murdered a good friend of mine CSI Warrick Brown.’ Jules says ‘So if McKeen’s in prison how does his gun end up committing all these murders?’ Greg says ‘He must have had someone do it for him. Like Gotti. Godfathering from the inside.’ Nick makes a face. DB says ‘We gotta play this smart. Kimble’s dirty but we have no idea how deep this goes.’ End of promo. :-)</blockquote>
So ... yay.

By the way, it's May. Jorja's birthday is July. You know what that means!
