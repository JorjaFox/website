## Synopsis

The CSIs investigate the murders of an Elvis impersonator and a bird that are strangely connected. Multiple killings in multiple cities lead the CSIs to find a connection between Greg's former pastime, chess, a chess tour, and a disgraced chess grand master. But the clues are not what they seem, when Greg's former mentor becomes a suspect and then a clue.

The killer turns out to be the woman running the chess tour, murdering out of hatred of the misogyny of the chess world.

## Review

Sara works the case as Greg's second, and while initially she thinks he might be a little stretching it for the chess connection, declares him a genius when it's true. At the end of the episode, Sara offers to play chess with Greg, in order to cheer him up.

## Quotes

**Greg:** Maybe the killer was making a reference to Edgar Allan Poe.\
**Sara:** Well then he needs to brush up on his birds. This isn't a raven it's a rook. See the white skin around it's beak?\
**Greg:** A rook.\
**Sara:** The weird thing is rooks are indigenous to central Europe and Asia. What's one doing in southern Nevada?
