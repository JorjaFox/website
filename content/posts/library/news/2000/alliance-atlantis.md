---

Starring William Petersen (To Live and Die in L.A.) and Marg Helgenberger (China Beach)

Series Executive Produced by Action Feature Film Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pearl Harbour, Con Air)

**August 9, 2000 - Toronto** - ALLIANCE ATLANTIS COMMUNICATIONS INC. announced today a co-production deal with CBS Productions and Jerry Bruckheimer Films Inc. to produce the one-hour crime drama ***CSI: Crime Scene Investigation***. Twelve one-hour episodes began filming in Los Angeles on August 2, 2000, to premiere on the CBS Television Network this fall on Friday nights at 9 p.m. (ET/PT). The one-hour pilot was shot earlier this year.

***CSI***, a weekly one-hour series, chronicles the fast paced lives of a passionate team of investigators in Las Vegas who are trained to solve crimes the old fashioned way-by examining every bit of evidence. **William Petersen** (*To Live and Die in L.A.*) heads the team of forensic heroes as "Gil Grissom," a senior forensics officer who, along with his team, works day and night solving crimes in ways that no other cops can. **Petersen** also serves as a Producer for the series.

Other members of the investigative team include "Catherine Willows" (**Marg Helgenberger** - *China Beach*), a single parent juggling the job she loves and her family; "Warrick Brown" (**Gary Dourdan** - *A Different World*) and "Nick Stokes" (**George Eads** - *E.R.*), who are in head-to-head competition to solve their 100th crime; "Sara Sidle" (**Jorja Fox** - *The West Wing*), the newest member of the team; and "Captain Jim Brass" (**Paul Guilfoyle** - *L.A. Confidential*), a no-nonsense kind of guy who is tough on everyone.

"CBS and Alliance Atlantis have built a great relationship over the years," said Peter Sussman, President, ALLIANCE ATLANTIS ENTERTAINMENT. "It's especially great to be expanding this relationship with a network series. "
