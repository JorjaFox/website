Ever since we got a Skype session with Grissom in "The Two Mrs. Grissoms" everyone's been on the boat of how they talked about having a dinner.  What would Grissom cook?  What would it be like?  Well guess what, kiddos, we're not the only ones who wondered.

The best way to put it is to quote it.
<blockquote>**_CSI_ |** Given the news that the upcoming season is very likely Marg Helgenberger’s last, it’d stand to reason that William Petersen might put in an encore, playing Gil to her Catherine. But as of Wednesday, when I spoke to show boss Carol Mendelsohn, nothing yet seemed set in stone. “Listen, every year we go to Billy – it’s sort of like a pilgrimage – to say, ‘Will you come back?’ And last year we were successful, and he came back for that one episode [via Skype with wife Sara].” And now? “We talked to Billy a few weeks ago, and he was talking about what Gil might cook for dinner for Sara — and he said ‘grilled cheese went very well with beer’ – so you never know. I mean, they _are_ married, and we’d like the audience to be able to see Gil and Sara sometime.” So cross fingers!</blockquote>
