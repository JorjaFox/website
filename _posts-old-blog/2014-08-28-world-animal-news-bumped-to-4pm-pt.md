YouÂ <em>will</em> be able to watch it live on <a href="http://TRadioV.com">TRadioV.com</a> or on their <a href="http://new.livestream.com/accounts/5644803/events/2458640">LiveStream Archive</a>. Good news? That archive will there for you for ... ever. So if you miss it, you can watch it later!

It's an hour long. I don't know if I can actually transcribe that whole thing without going insane.

Also my theory for the reschedule is that Jorja went surfing. The waves are intense today!
