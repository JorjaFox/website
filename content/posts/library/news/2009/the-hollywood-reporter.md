**Will appear in five episodes of the show's 10th season**

She's back from the jungle!

"CSI" favorite Jorja Fox, last seen in a cameo in William Petersen's final episode in January when their characters Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom reunited in Costa Rica, is returning to the veteran crime drama.

She is said to appear in five episodes of the series' upcoming 10th season, reprising her role as Sara.

"We're thrilled for Jorja's return to CSI," said executive producer/showrunner Carol Mendelsohn. "The viewers and longtime CSI fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode."

There are no immediate plans for Petersen, whose character had a romantic relationship with Sara, to return for more episodes.

CBS executives and "CSI" producers had said that they were looking to make significant creative changes on the show next season following a ratings slide following Petersen's departure.

"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" returns with new episodes Sept. 24.

Fox, one of the show's original cast members, left during the eighth season, when her character, suffering job burnout, decided to leave the crime lab to deal with past demons.

Fox is repped by Domain and Framework.
