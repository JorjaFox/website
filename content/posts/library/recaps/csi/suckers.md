## Synopsis

Three little CSIs (Grissom, Sara, and Nick) respond to an electrocution at a casino. The casino is hosting Japanese antiquities. The electroctution is just a ruse to steal the central piece of the exhibit. Catherine and Warrick deal with a 'vampire' murder.

## Review

Sara works closely with Grissom on the antiquities case, despite recent events . Together, she, Nick and Grissom discover that the antiques are fake. When Nick is confronted with the task of matching the security camera tape to the casino employee database, she puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.

## Notes

* Sara studies up on Japanese antiquities and realizes the armor is fake.

## Quotes

**Grissom:** Do you have any duct tape in your kit?\
**Sara:** Yeah, it's what I use to keep it together.
