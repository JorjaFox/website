From time to time, the music we play and with all the noise, we"d have to take a break from shooting. For example, they played Queen"s 'We will rock you', and the crowd got into it, dancing and waving their hands. Meanwhile, the crew and cast would walk around and record video of everyone. On another one of these breaks, Jorja Fox did an impressive little dance in a little hidden space behind video village. When she came out for the next take, I said to her, 'I caught your little dance. You got some moves, I was very impressed.' For the record, I thought she was quite good. 'You should do a musical. In fact, you should do a musical version of CSI, where everyone sings and dances.' Now I have to admit, I have always found Jorja Fox to be likeable on screen. Even back on West Wing, where she played a Secret Service agent, I wanted to see more of her and hoped that her storyline would get extended. And it turns out in real life, she"s actually exactly that -- very warm and friendly. When I met her at base camp, she immediately introduced herself in a very welcoming way, and when we took the van to set, she was like, 'Have you met everyone?' She played a bit of a host, even though she had, of course, no obligation to do so. So when I brought up the musical, she didn"t even blink, she said, 'Oh totally, and I have this great idea for it.' And she went on to describe how all the music and dancing could happen in one of the CSI character"s dreams. And then she said, 'I"ve been pitching this, you gotta help me sell it to the producers.' So later, I walked up to one of the producers, mentioned my conversation with Jorja, and the musical CSI Las Vegas idea. He sorted grunted, nodded, and walked off. Hmm... guess that went over well.
