"They have an expression that's so popular among the producers, writers and cast of CSI that they made it the title of a two part episode that will open the show's next season: Assume nothing.

Mainly it concerns the scientific unravelling of the most minute clues left in the wake of murders, when the CSI team moves in with its hi-tech equipment. But if you want to know about something that appears to be far more simple, say a personal relationship between the CSI team's aloof boss, Gil Grissom and TV's sexiest scientist Sara Sidle you can apply the same rule.

Danny Cannon a series executive producer and frequent director, says Grissom will "become more engaged with the world" as the show continues.

"You keep hearing that from writers, right?" Petersen, 50, responds when asked to explain the phrase. "I dont know what that means either, but I heard it, too. I think one thing Grissom has learned is that he either has much to learn or much to forget. I think he's very strong but he has his limitations and he focuses on what he's good at. It's not that he's never been out with a woman, it's just that he's never been in love with a woman, so that's not a priority for him.There's some change going on in him, some midlife situation he's going to have to address, but how he addresses it I have no idea." Petersen means, of course, that we should assume nothing.

"If he's smart he'll chase me, right?" quips 35 year old Fox."I came in originally as a love interest for Grissom and there is a back story then they changed their minds on that. So we know there's some history between them but we dont really know what it is. Still I think the dance will be played out." Then Fox pauses and adds "But I dont know for sure."

To Anthony Zuiker, who created CSI a romantic interlude between two of his main characters is a moot point anyway."We're a forensic procedural drama at heart," he says, a description which in itself would be likely to drain the romance out of anyone quicker than you can say "scapel". When we go into personal relationships in doses- I stress the word doses- it's so much richer when Jorja Fox wipes chalk off Billy Petersen's cheek, or he might call her 'honey'. It cames totally out of left field and when you hear those things it really gets everybody talking and excited versus us doing those beats constantly from page 0ne to page 60. It just wouldnt have the impact." So the balance between lab and love is likely to remain skewed heavily towars lab, althogh Zuiker of course adds: "But in short, assume nothing."
