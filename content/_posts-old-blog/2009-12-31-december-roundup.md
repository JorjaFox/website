Don't think you missed a photo shoot.

<h2>Happy New Year</h2>
The new year starts tomorrow.  2010.  Isn't that amazing?  CSI will finish it's 10th season in May and we've come a very long way since 1999, when this silly science show started.    In the 90s, Jorja was on three hit shows (<em>ER</em>, <em>The West Wing</em> and <em>CSI</em>).  In the 2000s, she was on just <em>CSI</em>.  I can't wait to see where she goes next!

Oh, and as a present for you, <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/12/30/some-videos-for-the-new-year/">here are some videos</a> to get you through the long night.

<h2>CSI</h2>
<span class="alignright" style="width:175px;">[polldaddy poll=2445662]</span>
We only got Jorja for one episode, but we got some interesting news.  Apparently there was a round of filming in Paris at the Sorbonne, which, as you know, is where Grissom is ensconced.  Could this be the return of Grissom? You can bet some <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/12/01/csi-in-paris-could-it-be/">rumors abounded</a> as we set off in a mad scramble for the truth!  We never found out what was happening, alas.

Speaking of France, the French magazine TeleStar reproduced the TV Guide Magazine interview from September, with <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/12/28/tele-star-interview-mostly-the-same-as-tv-guide/">a couple new tidbits</a> for you.  Sorry for the terrible translation. I took Latin in school.

<h3>CSI Episode</h3>

The next time we'll see Sara is for the January 21st episode "Long Ball."  It's about golf, not baseball.

<h2>Charity and Fundraisers</h2>
Don't forget that JFO and JAA are still accepting donations for AHOPE via a <strong><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jorjaallaround/607633.html">gift draw</a></strong> (which means if you donate, you might win pretty things), other Jorja related sites have had amazing success.

<strong><a href="http://joisaway09.livejournal.com/">Jo (aka Hodiestoe)</a></strong> raised enough money to go to Rwanda (we'll miss you!)!  Marg Helgenberger fansite <strong>Margamania</strong> raised $500 to the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen For the Cure</a> foundation to honor Marg.  The William Petersen Appreciation Page <strong><a href="http://billypetersen.com/site/2009/12/victory-gardens-fundraiser-final-donation-figure/">WPAP</a></strong> raised $1,500 for their <a href="http://billypetersen.com/site/fundraising/victory-gardens-fundraiser/">Victory Garden Fundraiser</a>.

Also, someone emailed me to thank me about the greyhound posting, and promises pics when she's brought her rescues home.  I can't wait!

<h2>JFO Site News</h2>
Basically all we did this month was upgrade software, patch things, and party like it's 2009.  There were a few hitches with the WordPress upgrade to 2.9. Since I'm a proponent of Open Source development, I allowed the errors to remain on JFO for a while so everyone could debug things. While that was going on, I 'upgraded' some of the navigation images. There are now 'share this' buttons on the blog (and gallery) so you can easily post to FaceBook, MySpace, Blogger, Twitter and StumbleUpon. If there's a social media you use I didn't list, please speak up and I'll see about adding it.

<h3>Happy 13th Birthday, JFO!</h3>
Did you know that JFO was 13 this month?  I thought it was only 12, but then I was reminded of my college filmography page for Jorja in 1996, which was actually the start of it all.  I was in an HTML class (using Netscape as the browser of choice) and they said 'Make a website for someone other than yourself.'  Who could have seen this outcome?

<h3>Site Policy</h3>
I want to remind people about the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/JorjaPedia:Policy">site policy</a> here which states:

<blockquote><strong>Speculation about Jorja Fox's personal life is not permitted</strong>
You're allowed to talk about anything that is open, public knowledge (her mother's death of cancer, for example), but anything that isn't (her sexuality or the rampant pregnancy rumors) are not welcome topics here. Frankly, we believe you should afford Jorja the same respect and privacy you would anyone else, and leave rumors out of her personal life. </blockquote>

A couple people have had their comments here removed due to violation of that policy and some felt it restrictive and disingenuous of me to promote her public life (her advocacy schedule for example) but to be so hard-lined about her private life.  To that, all I can say is that I'm sorry. I find invasion of privacy to be distasteful and disrespectful.  And yes, I know 'other sites' allow rampant speculation of anything an everything.  I don't and I'm not responsible for anything but here.  Private lives are private.  If you can't deal with that, no one's making you visit here.
