It's almost a relief to have such a low key episode (for Sara, sorry Morgan fans!). Still it was soft and subtle, and Jorja's looking very youthful in last night's episode.

Two Sara Stars, for not a lot of Sara. The only big Sara Plot Point was the lack of her ring.

Dun. Dun. Dun.

The screencaps are not the best quality, but I'm in a bit of a rush (headed to the airport!) so I'll see about getting better ones when I'm back from my business trip.
