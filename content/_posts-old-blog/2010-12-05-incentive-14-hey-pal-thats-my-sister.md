The boys think Connie's upset because they saw the guy in her wedding photos sucking face with a red-head at a bar.  Little do they know he's not her husband, he's her brother.  And Connie's actually upset because of a cancer scare.  It occurred to me, as I was capping this episode, that 1993 was around the time Jorja's mother's cancer diagnosis came through.  She died a mere five years later, while Jorja was working on <em>ER</em>.
