## Summary

Benton takes advantage of a grieving father for a chance to write a paper on a boy with reversed internal organs. George Henry returns to complete his clerkship and suffers a near fatal attack. Jeanie confronts Kerry and Anspaugh over what she perceives as wrongful termination. Cynthia's error forces the free clinic to open a week early; Carol enlists new ER nurse Yosh to help out. Mark strikes a deal with attorney Herb Spivak for legal representation.

## Review

When Jeanie gets fired, Doyle encourages her to talk to a Gay/Lesbian defense fund lawyer who has a lot of experience in HIV-related firings.

## Notes

* Maggie's still gay and willing to work the system for people she likes, or that she feels need help.
