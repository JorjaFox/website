Okay, this was a good episode. First of all, no one died. I always like a case where there's no real dead body. Second of all, it was very heavy on the Sara Scenes, which I know we all love. I mean, now I totally get why she wasn't really in Passed Pawns.

Sara catches the case of a guy found knocked out in a rain culvert, with a bomb. The bomb is fake, the bomber is fake, and it's all an FBI plot to catch some Armenian mobsters. The best moments? Sara holding back her sneeze and being terrified. Sara comforting Greg. Sara being pissed about handing the case over to the FBI.

I maybe went screenshot happy? There were a lot of moments where Sara's face was really important, okay.

Oh and I know a lot of people were talking about "chemistry" with Sara and the bomb guy. I'd like to point out, when Sara got blown up in <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Play_With_Fire">Play with Fire</a>, she was reckless afterwards, and asked Grissom out. This time? She was calm, controlled, and lost her appetite. No, I don't see any chemistry with her and the bomb guy, which is _very_ telling when you consider she told Brass it made her rethink things.
