## eGreetings: Vote in November (2004)

In 2004, a webmedia ad showed up, narrated by Jorja, urging people to get out and vote in November.

Specifically, this ad, which was available online in the fall and winter of 2004, spoke openly against voting for President George W. Bush.

The evidence was overwhelming, yet somehow it still seemed hard to believe. I was brought into the White House to examine the brain. They wanted answers, "I" was supposed to provide them. The cerebral cortex appeared normal at first. I followed the large fiber tracks and looked deeper into the basil ganglia, amygdale and hippocampus.

I listened to the audio tape again:

"We got issue in America. Too many good docs are getting out of the business. Too many OB-GYNs aren't able to practice their .. their love with women all across this country." - President George W. Bush, Poplar Bluff, Mo., Sept. 6, 2004

What on earth could he have been meaning to say!? I took apart the central nervous system, guial cells, neurons, and finally? found a crap load of hanging chads lodged within the limbic system.

I don't think we'll ever determine what he was meaning to say, but at least we can stop him from talking.

Vote in November.

Hi, I'm Jorja Fox. I'm on CSI sometimes. I don't know what I'm doing here at the DNC, I'm really confused. I'm in Denver. I just kidding! I'm here- I'm just honored, I feel so blessed I get to witness this amazing moment in history. Yes we can! Go Barak. Good luck, we love you. Thank you.
