I want to preface this with the remark that I may have replied to Lanos' email about this article in all caps. Seriously? This is a great article with a tonne of pictures that are wonderful. And a puppy!

Actress** Jorja Fox** is standing in the middle of an airplane hangar in Boulder, Colorado, watching the doors of a Bolivian cargo jet open up. While the sun sets over the Rocky Mountains, individual crates housing twenty-five African lions are unloaded. Although from different prides, the lions share the same fate: rescued from circus abuse, they’re about to embark on a new life. All of a sudden, one lion after the other starts roaring, the sound bouncing off the walls in the giant hangar. A lion’s roar can travel up to five miles, and the roars turn into a symphony never before heard on the Colorado plains. “It’s a sound that completely penetrates you,” says Jorja. “You can feel those roars in your muscles and bones. If something like that had happened in the wild, where I was surrounded by twenty-five lions, I would’ve been petrified! But I wasn’t scared. It was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever felt.”</blockquote>
The article goes on to talk about her personal life, CSI, the ADI, Lion Ark, and her new dog ... Bexar.
