Here's what's happening with Nicky in Season 13:
<blockquote>**Got any scoop on _CSI_? How will Nick rejoin the team after walking out last season? —_Bobby_
ADAM:** Surprisingly, it will all start with Nick getting drunk! "Nick goes on a bit of a bender," George Eads teases. "He challenges a couple guys with pistols that he shouldn't, and he ends up in a bad spot." Fortunately, Sara comes to his rescue, which makes him re-evalute the importance of his team. "He's the kind of guy who doesn't run from a fight," Eads says. "He got frustrated and fed up, but I don't think he would ever leave his teammates in the middle of battle."</blockquote>
