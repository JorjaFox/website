The 'Artists and Athletes Alliance' assists artists and athletes in navigating the halls of government, as well as helping them better understand the political process. By providing top-line educational information to artists and athletes through one-on-one meetings, private briefings, roundtable discussions, forums and other related events on the specific public policies and political issues of interest to them, the Alliance hopes to engage in productive dialogue with lawmakers, policymakers and opinion-leaders so the voices of the artistic and athletic community can be heard on the many important issues facing our nation.

Jorja serves on the Artists & Athletes Advisory Board and has attended many events.
