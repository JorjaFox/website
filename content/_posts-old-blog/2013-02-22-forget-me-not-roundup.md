As expected, news sources are reporting on it. Ratings are up! "<strong><em>CSI </em></strong>garnered a 2.3, up 21 percent from last week's series low 1.9 adults 18-49 rating." says <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/02/21/tv-ratings-wednesdayamerican-idol-down-but-still-wins-night-modern-family-survivor-csi-up-arrow-falls/170275/">TV By The Numbers</a>, which works out to 10.5 million viewers. Way better.

E!Online's TV Watercooler mourned the loss.
<blockquote><strong>Couples Watch:</strong> In sad, sad TV couples news, <em>CSI</em>'s Sara (<strong>Jorja Fox</strong>) and Grissom (<strong>William Petersen</strong>) are splitting up. After 13 years. We repeat: <em>13 years</em>, which is basically 100 years when it comes to TV relationships. Let's mourn together in the comments, shall we? We'll bring the chocolate, you bring the tissues.

TV Equals (written by a GSR fan) was just as gutted.
<blockquote>How did this happen? Well, in true<em> CSI </em>fashion, the writers didn’t seem at all interested in explaining their reasons for this twist. It’s apparently enough for them just to imply that it was Grissom’s choice and that he might have been doing it for what he considers to be Sara’s benefit. Anyone who knows the history between them, though, knows that Grissom has not always been the best judge of his own needs and wants, much less Sara’s. It’s going to be very easy for the anti-Sara crowd to point their fingers and blame her for the breakup, and the writers made it very easy for them by having her immediately fool around with another man, but the real question is why did this incredibly strong woman, who never gave up on her love for an impossible man, give up on her marriage?

Even CBS had something to say.

And if you're <em>still</em> freaking out about GSR, I wonder what this means....

Oh and they are listening.

But... to balance that out, Liz Devine said the following (<a href="http://talk.csifiles.com/showpost.php?p=1240453&amp;postcount=86">via TalkCSI</a>):
<blockquote> "Sorry to disappoint the Sara Grissom fans. But Sara deserves someone who puts her ahead of his work. More practically we are unlikely to get Billy back ever. We have begged for years. Hope you will keep watching. Episode 5 next season will be our 300th!!!</blockquote>
Your milage clearly varies depending on who you ask. For example, if you ask Jorja? "I'm hoping for a Sara, Grissom reunion" she said, in an interview with DigitalSpy that, clearly, was taken a while ago...
<blockquote><strong>Are there any plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to make another appearance following his cameo in season eleven?</strong>
"I think that there is some stuff [planned] - I'm always hoping for it. I feel like Sara's a little young to sleep alone every night and she's still very much in love with Grissom, so we're always thinking about and hoping for some type of reunion between the two of them - at least I am. That will be a story for Sara in season 13 - what it's like to have a long-distance relationship and how she's weathering all that."

So take of it <em>all</em> what you will.
