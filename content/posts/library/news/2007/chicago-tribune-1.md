Because I like stirring up "CSI" fans, I thought I'd post this summary of what's going to happen on the May 17 season finale of the CBS show. Standard spoiler alert: Avert your eyes if you don't want to know.

You'll recall that a year ago, fans of the show were either really happy or really angry that a romantic relationship between Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) was revealed. It sent the "CSI" message boards into a frenzy for months. (Petersen, Fox and producers addressed the controversy here, here and here.)

In any case, here's what happens in the upcoming season finale: "The 'miniature killer's' identity is revealed. As the CSI team tries to track down this diabolical murderer, Sara (Jorja Fox) mysteriously goes missing - and Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara's relationship is suddenly forced out into the open."

Dun-dun-dun!
