As part of the new extras they're pushing with _CSI_, CBS got David "Super Dave" Berman to tweet with us this afternoon. Reader Jeremy didn't believe it was him, so David proved it!

Of note, David Berman liked flirting with Jorja.

Also, when asked about how he got the job, he mentioned that great first scene with Jorja:
