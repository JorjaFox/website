William Petersen, star and executive producer of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," issued a statement Friday concerning reports that co-stars Jorja Fox and George Eads were fired.

Fox and Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes, were fired after asking for more money to stay on the show, according to reports from KCBS-TV and Variety.

Petersen said he is "very saddened and deeply disappointed that this is the turn of events," and that he hopes "cooler heads will prevail and everything will be rectified and restored in due course."

A call left for Petersen's publicist was not immediately returned Friday.

Eads didn't show up for work Thursday, the first day of production for the next season, according to the news station and Variety.

The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts.

Danica Smith, publicist for both Fox and Eads, told The Associated Press that Fox was fired Wednesday but did not have details. Smith could not confirm whether Eads was fired.

A CBS spokesman said the network had no comment.

Though a search was underway for their replacements, it's unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones, KCBS-TV and Variety reports said.

The show picked up four Emmy nominations Thursday, including one for best drama series.
