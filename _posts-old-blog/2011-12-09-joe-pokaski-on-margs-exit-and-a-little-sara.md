Joe who?  Why he's the new supervising producer!  Don't worry, though, he's the guy who did "Tell-Tale Hearts" so we know he knows how to handle our girl Sara!  Here are a couple tidbits:
<blockquote>**CSI Files**: When you guys ‘broke’ this season, how did the writers decide what kind of note Catherine would go out on? Was that part of the dinner conversation?

**Pokaski**: Yeah, I think that was part of it. I think burnout is interesting but it’s an easy place to go, and the fact that we did kind of go that direction with Sara [**Jorja Fox**] inparticular… you know, these people are kind of heroes. They’re kind of forsaking their families to solve murders and bring justice to other families. For me, I kind of focused on her as a superhero. She was just the best at her job and potentially, without spoiling too much, there might be another place where she can be the best at her job in another context.

[...]

**CSI Files**: At the beginning of the season it was said Nick (**George Eads**) would play a pivotal role in Catherine’s exit. Is that being shifted a bit–is DB Russell (**Ted Danson**) stepping up in that role?

**Pokaski**: I think everyone plays a pretty big role. The scene we shot [Wednesday]… the episodes kind of focus on how Catherine is touched by everyone. So Nick plays a pivotal role, as does Russell. We didn’t know who the actor was when we started breaking the story. I think it’s fair to say pretty much everyone does, especially Nick and Sara who’ve been around.</blockquote>
