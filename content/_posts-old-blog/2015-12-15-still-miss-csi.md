Before we hit 2016, I have a couple old-news to post. I got behind thanks to work travel (since October, I think I've been home 20 days or so...).

Anyone else still miss CSI? Oh good.

<h2>From Twitter</h2>

Some throwbacks on a Tuesday:

<h2>From the news</h2>

The A.V. Club <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/william-petersen-manhattan-michael-mann-and-sailin-229108">interviewed William Petersen</a> and asked him about <em>Manhattan</em> and <em>CSI</em> (of course).

<blockquote>
  <strong>AVC: So were you happy to come back in order for Gil and Sara to literally sail off into the sunset?</strong>
  
  <strong>WP:</strong>  Well, yeah, that was kind of… [Hesitates.] I mean, what are you going to do after all these years and everything, and you’re supposed to do a wrap-up in two hours? If they’d said, “Why don’t you do a wrap-up over several episodes?” we’d’ve done something different. But they sort of just sprang it on us after they canceled the show. They said, “Do you want to say goodbye?” And it was, like, “How do you do that?” We had to write it in six weeks and shoot it in four and then put it on the air. It was a cram job to get it done.
  
  But they had asked me, “What do you think Grissom’s been doing?” And I said, “Well, I think he’s in the ocean. I think he’s sick of dead bodies and bugs, and he wants to save fish.” So we put that together, and then they said, “Well, what are we going to do about you and Sara? The fans are desperate for you to deal with that.” So I said, “Well, just let ’em sail off into the sunset!” [Laughs.] I mean, if that’s what they want, why at this point would we care? Give ’em what they want! And I just thought it was sort of nice, in that we’d tried to stay away from that stuff all along. We even tried at the end to just keep it as simple as possible: off they go onto the boat. So I was good with it. I just hope that the fans, the people who watched it, were happy about it.

It's nice to know that Billy was somewhat responsible for sailing into the sunset. It may have been trite, but you know what, I was happy about it.
