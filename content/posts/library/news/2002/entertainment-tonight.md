"CSI" star JORJA FOX tells ET that even though she hasn't received a script for the upcoming season of the CBS drama, she can guarantee it's going to be scary. While Fox was enjoying her summer hiatus from show, she took time to help out a cause dear to her heart: the environment. Fox posed for the Environmental Communications Office's educational campaign about global warming. Long an advocate of the cause, Fox hopes that the effort will help preserve the earth for generations to come.
