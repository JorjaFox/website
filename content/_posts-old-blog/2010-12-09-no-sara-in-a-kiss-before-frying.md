I was looking forward to it.  Ah well.

<blockquote>"A Kiss Before Frying" — The CSIs link a body with severe burn marks to possible execution by electric chair – and to a legendary Vegas murder.  Meanwhile, Greg asks out Ellen, a pretty schoolteacher and forensics enthusiast who has been touring the crime lab, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, Jan. 13 (9:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.  Burlesque artist Dita Von Teese guest stars as Greg's new love interest, Ellen.
