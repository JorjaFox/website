<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/11/humanechicago-100x100.jpg" alt="humanechicago" title="humanechicago" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2109" /> Saturday February 27th, Jorja Fox* will come to my town, Chicago, to host a fundraiser to stop dog fighting.  Spotlight Humane is Chicago's 5th annual gala to raise money and awareness to one of the cruelest 'sports' in America.

Tickets are $150 and cocktail attire is suggested.

All proceeds from the event will benefit The HSUS's End Dogfighting in Chicago campaign. This innovative program is designed to educate youth about the brutality and dangers of dogfighting. It also supports expanded police efforts to find and arrest dogfighters citywide.

<em>*Jorja's appearance is subject to schedule changes. My appearance is unlikely due to the cost and the attire ... I don't think I own anything cocktail, but I'll be donating!</em>
