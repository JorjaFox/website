The what now?

Executive producer **Don McGill **had an interview with Comcast xFinity about CSI Season 14 and dropped this gem:
<blockquote><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8502" alt="Dead Air - We need to talk" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/09/deadair-388.jpg" width="300" height="168" />4. Weddings and divorces. It looks as if Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) may be headed for a divorce. Any chance he will return this season to deal with that?

“Sara and Grissom decided to take a timeout in their relationship,” McGill says. “It is not necessarily a divorce. That’s really where we left it. I don’t know if we will be revisiting that at the beginning of the season. Certainly, there are undertones of Sara dealing with the fallout of her relationship. Right now, we don’t anticipate Billy coming back, but you never know.”

That last bit is really important. Billy's probably not coming back any time soon, so how to do move a story forward without him and appease the majority of fans? Is having a reconciliation we never see okay, given that they can't force Billy to come back? Or is having the relationship end more realistic than the 'Well they're happily married but totally apart' status quo?
