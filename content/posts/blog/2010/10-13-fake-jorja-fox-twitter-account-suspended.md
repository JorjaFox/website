<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/10/twitter-suspended-100x100.jpg" alt="" title="twitter-suspended" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2642" /> If you go to http://twitter.com/jorjafox or try and look at your old tweets to and from @jorjafox on Twitter, you were in for a surprise today.  The account is suspended.

This doesn't surprise me.  Last month I emailed Jorja's personal assistant, apologizing for mixing it up with the fake account (honestly, I do know better, I just lost my temper a bit), and mentioning that he (or the agency) actually had the authority to tell Twitter to shut down the account. He said he'd look into it.  Clearly it had an effect. I owe him a thank you card.

Now, my personal view on how Twitter handles fakes, bullies, and harassers aside, I want to remind you all there are a couple easy ways to tell if a celeb account is fake on Twitter.  Once you've figured out someone's fake, yes, tell people, but be aware this may start their supporters cyberbullying you.  If that happens, right now all you can do is block the users on Twitter, but I also suggest opening help tickets with Twitter about it.  Today, all they do is intervene if there are specific violent threats, but hopefully that will change one day.

**The URL**: This one's pretty easy. If they use a URL of a fansite, or of Twitter itself, it's probably not the real deal.  Most stars have their own URLs.  Jorja has two, and one of them is her personal stuff, so she would, logically, point to that.  Another good trick they use is to point to things like this: <code>http://https://twitter.com/ACCOUNT</code>  Notice how it's got two http calls in there? As far as I've been able to tell, anyone with this sort of URL is one of a series of rather aggressive, hate filled, people who have harassed quite a few people (myself included).  These people I automatically block AND report as spam!

**The Language**: There's a fake Nicollette Sheridan account that posts things like "MAN YOU ARE JUST AS UGLY AS A PERSON GETS, THATS FOR SURE....OINK OINK, I SEE A PIGGY!!"  I don't claim to be the Nicollette expert like I am Jorja, but even I can look at that and go "This is NOT her!"  Sure, certain stars are known for foul language (I stopped following Kevin Smith because he's not safe for work!) but generally stars know better than to act the raw prawn in public.  Once again, block these people and report as spam.

**The Followers**: Actually, by this I mean the people _they_ follow and who follow them back.  Once you know one account is fake, take a look at who follows them.  Odds are, if they're followed by (and follow) another account you know to be fake, then they're probably fake too.  The MargHelg twitter account, for example, follows the JorjaFox one, _AND_ posts that she'll DM her information.  Can we say fake, children?  Block and report as spam.

I wish I could tell you _why_ people feel the need to fake being a celeb. It's probably the same reason they feel it's okay to bully people.  I also wish Twitter and Facebook did a little more to protect people who are being harassed by these sorts, but that's an ongoing personal project of mine.  I personally believe in accountability, both online and offline.  Take ownership for your actions.  Which is why I admonish people for attacking the attackers.  Fight back, but fight back wisely and correctly.  Report them as spam and file a complained.  If enough of us do it, we can change the world.
