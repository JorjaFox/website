Jorja Fox - "Marriage? It gives me the shivers!"

At 36 years, this New Yorker is an atypical and secritive member of the CSIs. Thanks to this series' great acclaim, Jorja Fox achieved great popularity while preserving her mystery.

Tele Star: Recent rumours indicated that you were no longer part of CSI. True or false?

Jorja Fox: Both! In fact, I was fired. But they called me back within a week. I have to admit that it was a truly weird experience.

Tele Star: What really happened?

Jorja Fox: I wanted to renegotiate my contract and asked for an increase to my salary ($100,000). They didn't want to and showed me the door.

Tele Star: How do you explain your return to CSI?

Jorja Fox: It's thanks to the efforts of the other actors on the show and, especially, of the public, who reacted very negatively upon learning of my firing. Thus, I was back, but without an increase.

Tele Star: Did you always want to be an actor?

Jorja Fox: No. When I was 5, I liked doing little skits for my family, but nothing more. As a child, my great love was the sea. In fact, despite my atypical body shape <eta: I think she's referring to her height, but I couldn't be sure; I don't think there's anything wrong with her body shape>, I became a model. But I quickly understood, after several trips abroad, and in particular in Europe, that my career as a top model was very limited.

Tele Star: To come back to the show and to the character of Sara Sidle, do you have, like her, a scientific soul?

Jorja Fox: Not at all! Dissecting corpses, it's not really my cup of tea. I'm more of an artistic type.

Tele Star: What's going to happen to Sara in the next few episodes?

Jorja Fox: All I can tell you is that the writers keep promising to show a little bit of Sara's path. In the end,, they always seem to find a dark story for her.

Tele Star: And her love story with Grissom?

Jorja Fox: It's a story that never seems to end! But I think that, this year, we'll see them together a little.

Tele Star: To this effect, I've heard that you're allergic to marriagee

Jorja Fox: Just to think about it gives me heart palpitations. It's like I can't breathe. It sends shivers down my spine! But I still believe in true love.
