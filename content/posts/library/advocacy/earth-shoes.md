Earth shoes are extremely comfortable shoes, made in a &#8216;negative heel' design that is reported to alleviate stress on the lower back and improve posture.

The Negative Heel technology was developed by Danish Yoga Master, Anne Kalso. This design positions the heel slightly lower than the toe to promote a more natural posture with the head straight, shoulders rolled back and spine and pelvis aligned, allowing the back to form its natural arch. Though some may find the shoes to strain their Achilles tendon, it will encourage flexibility (which is a good thing). The downside is that some calf conditioning will be lost. The best results may be found by alternating between 'higher heel' shoes and the 'negative heel' ones.

The Earth company has expanded their product line to a series of Vegan shoes for men and women. Jorja Fox, among other stars, support the shoes.
