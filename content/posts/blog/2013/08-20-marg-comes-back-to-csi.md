Episode five of season 14 is the 300th episode of CSI. That number blew my mind. I've watched about 300 hours of this show? Yikes! And just if you're worried, Marg herself confirmed on Twitter.

<blockquote>Helgenberger's appearance will partially take place in a series of flashbacks. "We will flash back 14 years to seminal moments that show Catherine, Nick (George Eads), Sara (Jorja Fox), Greg (Eric Szmanda) and Ecklie (Marc Vann) as they were, [and how that] informed the evolution of the characters now. It's going to be a really fun episode, very emotional, that honors 14 years of _CSI_," McGill said.</blockquote>
So yes, Jorja will be in the episode. And I guess Ecklie's not dying. Note: There's no news about Billy coming back. I would assume he's not coming, though, unless a miracle occurs, just based on everything else, including the fact that he's working in Chicago right now.
