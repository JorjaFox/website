TJ, who is pretty much a Twitter Regular, got quoted in TVLine's Readers' 2013 Wishes. And what was the wish for? GSR of course!

TJ: This one is so easy: A Grissom appearance for the _CSI_ fans would be a real treat. Mistletoe kiss between Sara and Grissom, anyone?</blockquote>

What are your CSI wishes for 2013? Or if you don't have any, what do you wish for in general, or for Jorja?

I wish for another great year of personal success for myself. I've changed my life so much this year, and all for the better. As many of you know, I worked for a bank for almost 15 years. This August I quit to work for DreamHost, broke my lease and moved to California in October. So it's been a big upheaval that still doesn't feel quite real. My CA drivers license is in the mail, and soon I'll go to Disney Land.
