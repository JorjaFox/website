Former longtime "The Price Is Right" host Bob Barker joined "CSI" actress Jorja Fox and Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., to introduce the "Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act," which will prohibit exotic animals from being able to travel with circuses.

"Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun and I think we can do more for our kids by doing the compassionate thing and the respectful thing. If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they would actually be very disappointed in us for bringing them to these places," Fox said on the Hill Wednesday morning.

"I would like to see Ringling Brothers closed, It's all animal exploitation," Barker chimed in.

The 87 year-old animal advocate told Yeas & Nays the price is definitely wrong for animals who are forced into traveling circus shows.

"The price that these animals pay is that they live horrible lives, terrible lives. The day they die is probably the best day of their lives because then they escape the misery of the circus," he said.
