In other "CSI" news, according to the Hollywood Reporter, two supporting actors on the show, George Eads and Jorja Fox, have been let go amid a salary scuffle with the series' producers.

Eads and Fox, both of whom have been with the hit forensic drama since its debut in fall 2000, had approached the network about a salary increase for the coming season, sources said. CBS is said to have responded with what industry sources described as a modest take-it-or-leave-it offer of an increase.
