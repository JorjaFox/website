Although there's no official confirmation from CBS, sources confirm that fired CSI actress Jorja Fox has been given her job back - but at her old $100,000-per-episode salary. (Poor thing.) "There will be no renegotiation," says a source close to the show. Ditto Fox's co-star George Eades, who apparently did just enough groveling at the TCA press tour on Wednesday. "Let me tell you, I've apologized nine ways to Sunday," he told reporters. "It's a big misunderstanding, straight up. I want all this to work out. CSI is a part of who I am."
