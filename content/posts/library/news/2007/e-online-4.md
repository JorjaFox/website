Well, I suppose this puts the nail in the coffin. Sorry, Sara Sidle fans.

Despite the promo taunting you all with a Gil-Sara marriage proposal, Jorja Fox has confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that she's leaving "CSI", saying she will appear in only five episodes this season.

"There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old," explains Fox. "If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by, I have to get off the ride for a while."

"For a while" makes it sound as though Jorja may be back. So, what do you think? Is the show better off without her, or are you desperately hoping she'll return? Post your opinions below.
