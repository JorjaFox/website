The plan is to get them up this weekend (which has no meaning except being the anniversary of when I took them down), provided I get over my head-cold.

Meanwhile, are there any features in a forum you consider 'Must Have'?

Obviously the ability to post, and edit posts (if there's no post after you), a way to tell what's new and what isn't, and such are staples of forums. But what's your favorite (or least favorite) thing about forums?  Do you love PMs? Do you hate them? Do you want clickable smiles? What about allowing anonymous guests to post?  Speak up!
