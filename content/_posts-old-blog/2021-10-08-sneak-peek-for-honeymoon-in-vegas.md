<p>There's another new episode next week:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle come to the aid of a former colleague who is implicated in tampering with evidence. Maxine and the rest of the CSI team work the murder of a couple slain on their wedding day, following the evidence to the salacious underbelly of the Las Vegas elite, on CSI: VEGAS, Wednesday, Oct. 13 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds like Grissom and Sara won't be able to help Hodges. Actually it sounds like no one will. What do you think will happen?</p>

<p>(Obviously they'll do something or this will be a super short series and we know it's 10 episodes.)</p>
