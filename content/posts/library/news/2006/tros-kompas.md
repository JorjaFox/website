Whether she plays doctor Maggie Doyle on ER, or forensic investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, **Jorja Fox** always plays ambitious, smart and somehow a little standoffish women. "They don't have any boyfriends, no friends and no sex", she says, quasi-sadly. "I've played with George Clooney, and I'm currently playing with Gary Dourdan (Warrick on CSI), who's currently on the list with the most beautiful men, but kissing with them, no chance." Also, in private, things aren't good in love, Jorja (pronounced Georgia) lives together with a boxer and two cats. "I work from 5 am till 11 pm", she says. "You don't get any boyfriends with that, no friends either, let alone sex."
