This came up when <a title="CSI Moves to Sunday" href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/csi-moves-to-sunday/">the new schedule was announced</a>, and we were told _CSI_ will air on Sunday and **then** _CSI: Cybe_r takes it's spot. At the time, I speculated _CSI_ would air all 22 eps, and CBS said that they'd air 'straight through.' This was brought up again on <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News/Ask-Matt-Cancellations-Louie-Person-Interest-Blacklist-Castle-Finale-1082023.aspx">TV Guide's Ask Matt</a>:
<blockquote>**Question:** I'm a big fan of Patricia Arquette and am anxiously awaiting her new _CSI: Cyber_ series. I was disappointed to read that _CSI: Cyber_ won't begin until all the original _CSI_ episodes have aired in its new Sunday time slot. Does that mean _Cyber_ won't start until May, or will the original _CSI_ have a shortened season? — Victoria

**Matt Roush:** The idea as I understand it is to run _CSI_'s 15th season straight through until early spring with no repeats, and that would most likely be a full-season order of 22, which means _Cyber_ would probably get the short order of its initial 13-episode pickup without a back-nine — the spring tryout (probably starting in March or thereabouts) presumably leading to a full-season order for year two if all goes well.</blockquote>
So to translate a little... _CSI_ starts filming abnormally early this year. In fact, they start next month! Normally they don't start until around July. In part, this is because production of _CSI_ is a lot of post-processing work (the TMI graphics for example and the dead bodies). When you consider what _Cybe_r's doing, they also need more time.

Well for one, y'all can stop freaking out about _CSI_ getting a short season. the show is doing well enough, and it was moved to Sunday in part because it's proven to be stable with regards to moves. People will follow it. In addition, it's a surprisingly _bad_ pairing with crime dramas! When _CSI_ was at it's best, it followed _Survivor_. Once they moved that, _CSI_s ratings dropped, which implies that people who watch _CSI_ aren't generally crime show aficionados as much as all that. I think that a _CSI_/_Elementary_ pairing would be different, as the latter is a drama with crime (vs a crime with drama), but _Elementary_ is also low a little low.

And we're into major speculation land here, but I think a Sunday move is a good thing for _CSI_'s long term sustainability. _The Good Wife_ has proven that Sunday is not a barren landscape, and I think the smarter dramas (no offense to _Criminal Minds_ but it's not 'thinking' so much as crime in my eyes, like _Law &amp; Order_) will be a better lead in.

Bonus guess? CBS will move _Survivor_ to Sunday, before _The Good Wife_ and _CSI_ mid-season, when the _Madame Secretary_ bombs totally. Oh yes, that's my pick for first death. After all, <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/21/survivor-cagayan-28-seasons/">_Survivor_ is one of those things that goes forever</a>.
