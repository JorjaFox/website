Jorja Fox

Name: Jorja Fox

Character: Smitten investigator Sara Sidle on "CSI" (Thursdays at 9 p.m. on WBZ, Ch. 4)

Hometown: Melbourne Beach, Fla.

Age: 38

Where you've seen her before: Fox was Agent Gina Toscano in "The West Wing" and Dr. Maggie Doyle in "ER." She also guest starred in the landmark coming-out episode of "Ellen."

Fun fact: She didn't find out that Sara and Grissom (William Petersen) would be revealed to be in a romantic relationship until four days before shooting the scene.

On going up against "Grey's Anatomy" this season: "There will be very little about our show that will change. I don't think we're going to try to be more like 'Grey's.' I think that would be really foolish of us to do. I think that we've got a loyal following for what we've done, and they've got a really amazing following for what they've done."

On playing out the Sara and Grissom relationship: "You have to think all over again, really who is this person and how would she respond and how would she be in this situation. Because she had a couple of boyfriends that she liked, but her sights have sort of always been on this one man."

On how she feels about the Sara and Grissom story line: "These two people, they have a lot in common. They're both really not great with people in many respects, and they're emotionally detached in many respects. If two people like that can kind of find each other, there's something really beautiful in that."

Where you'll see her in five years: Helping to launch the spin-off "CSI: Boise."
