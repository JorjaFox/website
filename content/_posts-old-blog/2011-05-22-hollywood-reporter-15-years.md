So someone, I'm not sure who, put an advert in the Hollywood Reporter for Jorja, congratulating her on 15 consecutive years on TV.  That's a pretty neat thing, knowing that for 15 straight years, she's been on the boob tube in Prime Time!

If you know who put this ad in, please speak up so we can all thank them!  If you want the magazine, it's the May 13th issue of the Hollywood Reporter.
