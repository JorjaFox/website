Jorja Fox is returning to "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" as a series regular in the fall.

The actress was a series regular for the first seven seasons, playing tenacious forensic scientist Sara Sidle. Fox left at the beginning of Season 8 and returned only as a guest star the following seasons. But now she's coming back to Clark County for good, TV Line reported.

Fox will be starring alongside Ted Danson, who recently replaced outgoing Laurence Fishburne as head of the investigation team for the procedural during the CBS show's 12th-season shakeup.

Fox has appeared on "ER" as Dr. Maggie Doyle and played Agent Gina Toscano on "The West Wing." She'll also star in Ben Stern's indie drama "3 Weeks to Daytona" with Scott Cohen this year.
