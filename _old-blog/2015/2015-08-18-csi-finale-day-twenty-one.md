More photos, more news. The news is from the behind the scenes video from <a href="http://extratv.com/videos/0_mjhid6vd">ExtraTV</a> (not embeddable!). Jorja's segment is transcribed for you at <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/ExtraTV_(18_August_2015)">https://jorjafox.net/wiki/ExtraTV_(18_August_2015)</a>

So Sara's running the case! No wonder she's in every scene!

I missed this one from yesterday (shows how busy things are):

It was also Marc Vann's last day (looks like Ecklie lives, thank god). Looking at Paul's last day, it takes place in a casino with Catherine. One presumes it's Catherine's (aka Sam Braun's) casino.
