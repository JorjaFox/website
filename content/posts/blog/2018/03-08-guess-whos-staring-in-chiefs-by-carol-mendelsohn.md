Seriously. I squeed.

_Chiefs_ is about three successful police chiefs in different precincts in L.A. County. Jorja will be Vicky, the Santa Monica Chief of Police. They rewrote the role _for her_.

Stubborn and uncompromising, Vicky’s a bull in a china shop. She’s tough and focused — the type of person you’d pick to win in a fight. The mother of a 15-year-old and happily married to a software consultant, she is devoted to her family and to her job.
