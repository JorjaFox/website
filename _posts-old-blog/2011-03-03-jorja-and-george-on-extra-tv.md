<blockquote>Thursday, March 3: Jorga Fox and George Eads (10:00 AM) and Catherine Bell (1:30 PM)</blockquote>

I had to start a new 'Social Media' gallery for this stuff!

Extra TV is on at 4pm (seriously? Who's home by then!?) but re-airs at 1:35am, so I'm recording it then in the hopes of catching any bits with her.
