Yesterday Jorja was at [the Guibord Center’s Fundraising Dinner with Tim Phillips](https://theguibordcenter.org/about/funding/annual-fundraising-dinner/fundraising-dinner-2018/) and other members and associates from Lion Ark. As Tim says:

Some of my favourite people at The Guibord Center event tonight. Patty Shenker, Jorja Fox, Jan, and Gwynne Guibord and Lo Sprague. An amazing night. A huge audience eating an amazing vegan meal - many for the first time I suspect. And sitting captivated as leading figures from 12 different religions spoke one after the other saying it was time to defend animals.
