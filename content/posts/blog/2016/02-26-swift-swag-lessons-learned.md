	<li>Give you guys advanced notice</li>
	<li>Figure out better international shipping</li>
	<li>Don't start it when I've got a cold</li>
</ol>
I admit, the reason I didn't give you advance notice is I wanted to surprise you with Jorja's video. Best laid plans!

The reason I left international shipping off is that for the shirts it's $23.95 to ship to Canada. Crazy, right? That's doubling the cost!

And the cold... I blame the flight to Miami plus the business conference. I picked up con-crud.

All that said, I mailed off the first batch today at lunch, and there are two items left for sale:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=191813685609">CSI Season 5 Set Lighting T-Shirt</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=191813685122">CSI Season 6 Crew Baseball Shirt</a></li>
</ul>
Sadly for the next round that I'm lining up, its a lot messier.

The remaining items are all framed photos, and most are over 38 inches tall. USPS won't mail them, they're too big, so that means FedEx or UPS, and that means minimum $25 for shipping. From what I gleaned talking to people, it's more like $40. I'm getting them appraised for shipment, though, to be sure about this.

Which brings up another point. These frames are pretty honking big and unique and pricing them in general has been incredibly hard. Everything else was easy. I took the prices for regular CSI shirts and hats and such and off we went to the races. The delay in putting them up for purchase is surrounding that. I want to sell them for a reasonable and fair price to everyone.

The one on the left is posterboard and a little beat up. The one on the right is framed beautifully. They're both around three feet tall.

Yikes. Anyone who's had a hand in selling large posters, framed, drop me a line. I could use the estimate help!
