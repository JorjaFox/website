Macy’s Passport Fund supports agencies providing HIV/AIDS programming in certain counties with an operating Macy’s store location.

One of the nation's longest-running HIV/AIDS fundraisers, The Macy's and American Express HIV/AIDS Fundraiser (often referred to as Passport) has brought the excitement of live theatre and the best of Macy's fall collections for men, women and children to audiences while raising over $10 million for HIV/AIDS agencies.

Jorja attended the fundraiser in 2002.
