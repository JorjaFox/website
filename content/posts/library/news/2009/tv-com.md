**Jorja Fox returning to CBS' hit drama for multiple episodes. **

What does an actor do when they have an open invitation to return to one of television's biggest shows? Come back, of course.

Actress Jorja Fox's revolving-door relationship with "CSI" continues to spin, as CBS today announced the news that she'll be back to play the popular character Sara Sidle when the forensics drama returns in the fall. Fox left the show as a regular in 2007, but made a short return (and was last seen) during William Petersen's final episode of the show last season.

"We're thrilled for Jorja's return to "CSI"," said "CSI" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. "The viewers and longtime "CSI" fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the "CSI" team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode."

CBS says Sara will be back for "multiple episodes," but Reuters news service gets a little more specific and claims the episode count will be five. Reuters also claims that producers were looking to boost the show's profile and ratings after viewership dropped following Petersen's departure.

Fox originally left the show to focus on different professional and personal projects, but was told by the network that she could return if she wanted to.

"CSI" returns for its tenth season this fall on CBS.
