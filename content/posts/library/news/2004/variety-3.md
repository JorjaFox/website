CBS has rehired "CSI" star Jorja Fox and is talking to George Eads about a reprieve as well.

Fox will be back on the set of "CSI" when the show resumes production next week, insiders said. The actress was axed last week when CBS execs believed she had failed to comply with a request to sign a letter stating she had no plans to skip work while she and several other thesps sought raises.

Thesp, via reps, has said she *did* return the letter but did so via mail rather than fax, making the entire incident a misunderstanding. It's unclear if CBS ever received Fox's form in the mail.

It's believed Fox is returning to "CSI" at the same salary of roughly $100,000 per episode she had been making before she was fired.
