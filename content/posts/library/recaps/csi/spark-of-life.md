## Synopsis

Two CSI investigations intertwine when a woman's suicide in the Vegas wilderness is linked through evidence to the murder of a suburban family. Grissom discovers a connection between the fiery suicide of a woman in the Vegas wilderness and the slaughter of an entire family in a suburban home. The evidence exposes a couple's infidelity, as well as the unthinkable results of one woman's desperate attempt to get pregnant.

## Quotes
