<blockquote>While Harry Hamlin is off romancing Chris Colfer on Glee, his real-life main squeeze—and one of the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills — Lisa Rinna plays a worried (and way irresponsible) mom on Sunday’s episode of CSI. Airing as the first part of the CBS procedural’s two-hour season finale (which could turn out to be its series finale as it has yet to be officially renewed), "Under My Skin" casts Rinna as Cindi, an out-of-her-depth mother whose two teenage daughters are kidnapped — a case that naturally requires the talents of Las Vegas’s top CSI team to crack.

In this exclusive clip, a visibly frustrated Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who is trying to get the teary-eyed mom to confirm the identity of a key suspect in her daughters’ disappearance. It turns out the suspect had been sending graphic photos and texts to one of the girls — and Cindi soon learns less-than-attentive parenting style could have deadly consequences.</blockquote>
