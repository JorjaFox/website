I generally ignore parody sites, but since people have been getting confused, I want to explain about <a href="http://en.mediamass.net/">Mediamass</a>.

The Mediamass Project is amazingly simple: Media criticism through satire. It's like the Onion (also not a real news site), but with the express intent of showing you how stupid news is in a less obvious way. In my experience the Onion is pretty clearly a satire site, where as Mediamass is able to touch the real-factor so closely, you might, for a second, believe it.

The truth? It's all fake. And last year they started a new feature called 'people':
<blockquote>The ‘People’ section is a humorous parody of Gossip magazines, all stories are obviously not true.</blockquote>
Well I thought it was obvious, but some people freaked out when they found the <a href="http://en.mediamass.net/people/jorja-fox">Jorja Fox People Section</a>, and read headlines like "<a title="Jorja Fox engaged?" href="http://en.mediamass.net/people/jorja-fox/engaged.html">Did she just Get Engaged?</a>" and "<a title="Jorja Fox Nude Photos Leaked Online" href="http://en.mediamass.net/people/jorja-fox/nude-pics.html">Shocker: Actress Nude Photos Leaked Online</a>"

One thing I find totally awesome about that site is <em>how</em> they make their fake covers. They have two images, one of Jorja and one of the 'cover', and they just use CSS to overlay them. I'm a little nerdy, but I love it.

So anyway, they're all fake, don't panic. Read them and have a chuckle.
