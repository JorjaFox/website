Let's see, CSI's suspected for murder, someone's missing, and people get shot at? I don't know about you, but I'm starting to regret my trip to Vegas next month (I'm going to give a talk about running websites... go figure).
<blockquote>The ladies of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation are expecting a relaxing weekend vacation but find themselves at the center of an abduction when Finlay goes missing in "Girls Gone Wild."

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9401" alt="csi-crime-scene-investigation" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/11/csi-crime-scene-investigation-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Sara (Jorja Fox), Finlay (Elisabeth Shue), and Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) expect to sit back and unwind when they trade the bright lights of Vegas for a small town spa. Unfortunately, the women encounter a slight hiccup in their plans when they realize Finlay has disappeared. Soon every one in the seemingly peaceful neighborhood is under suspicion - even the local cops - and D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) brings the rest of the team together to find their blood spatter expert.

"Next week's episode will be a fun departure episode with all of our ladies. #CSI," tweeted the CSI Writers' Room. "But don't worry, the boys will be in it too."

That includes George Eads' Nick Stokes. After a several week absence from the CBS show, Eads returned to the screen last week in "Check In and Check Out."

Hopefully the team's most recent abductee, Morgan, won't find that the case hits too close to home. However, a recent tweet from Harnois makes it sound like her character will spend the episode wiping the floor with their suspects.

"Next week's #csi episode is badass," Harnois tweeted. "Make sure to tune in if you wish to see some unusual behavior from Sara, Finn and me!"</blockquote>
