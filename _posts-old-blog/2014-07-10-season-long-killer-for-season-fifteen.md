Last season was pretty free of serial killers. This season will be different as the season opens with a killer come back to haunt DB.

As EW puts it:
<blockquote>Mark-Paul Gosselaar will play a notorious serial killer on _CSI_ this fall.

Mark-Paul Gosselaar will also _not_ play a notorious serial killer on CSI this fall.

Confused? Here’s the deal: EW can exclusively reveal that the _Franklin &amp; Bash_ star (who, let’s face it, you still know best as Zack Morris on _Saved By the Bell_) has booked an arc on CBS’s venerable procedural—and that he’ll be playing twins named Jared Briscoe and Paul Wintrhop. One of the brothers is an unrepentant murderer about to be executed for his crimes; the other, according to CBS, is “a real estate magnate and a pillar of the community who insists on his brother’s innocence.” Neither, presumably, has a cell phone that <a href="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgfcidcKLE1qh3qkyo1_500.jpg">looks like this</a>.

The fifteenth season of _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ premieres Sunday, Sept. 28 on CBS.</blockquote>
