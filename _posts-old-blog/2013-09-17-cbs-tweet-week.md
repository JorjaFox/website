It's so cute when they try to be cool.
<blockquote>CBS Stars and Creative Talent to Chat and Tweet Live with Fans,

Share Photos and Videos, and Give Away Show Merchandise

Fans Can Go Behind the Scenes of the #Emmys with CBS.com’s Social Media Ambassador, “Criminal Minds” Star Shemar Moore

SAN FRANCISCO – Sept. 17, 2013 – #CBSTweetWeek (<a href="http://cbs.com/tweetweek">cbs.com/tweetweek</a>) is back bigger than ever and ready to ignite a #FanFrenzy for CBS Television’s fall premieres from Wednesday, Sept. 18 - Thursday, Oct. 3. Many of the Network’s stars and creative talent will be signing on to chat and tweet live with fans. They’ll be sharing more content with fans this year than ever before using #CBSTweetWeek’s new photo booth and video station to share photos and videos on Twitter, Instagram and Vine, along with #CBSTweetWeek giveaways of show merchandise. In addition to #CBSTweetWeek, fans can also watch exclusive content around the new and returning shows in CBS.com’s <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/fall-premieres-2013/">Fall Premieres</a> hub.

This #CBSTweetWeek fans can also follow CBS.com’s Emmy Awards social media ambassador, CRIMINAL MINDS’ Shemar Moore, as he provides live updates leading up to and during THE 65TH PRIMETIME EMMY AWARDS airing Sunday, Sept. 22 (8:00 PM, ET/5:00 PM, PT) on the CBS Television Network.</blockquote>
Just so you know, TweetWeek's page still shows April, not September. Oops.

And who do we get on Wednesday, Sept. 25: 10:00 PM, ET / 7:00 PM, PT for CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION (#CSI)?
