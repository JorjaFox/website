Sorry for the late notice,but tonight the Surfrider Foundation (and Emergen-C) is hosting BLUE Note Karaoke Experience at the Key Club in West Hollywood.  Raising money to clean 2/3rds of the planet (i.e. water), the Blue Note Karaoke Experience allows audience members to get up on stage and perform their favorite songs with the backing of a live band.

And yes, Jorja is expected to be there.

The doors open at 8pm at The Key Club (9039 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA).  Admission is $10 at the door, or hit up Ticketmaster.
