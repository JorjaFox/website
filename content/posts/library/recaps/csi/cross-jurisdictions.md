## Synopsis

Grissom and his crew handle their highest profile case to date when the city's former chief of detectives is slain execution-style in his house following a wild party. Missing from the residence are the chief's trophy wife and their 7-year-old daughter. When several motorists report seeing the girl along an access road near Miami, Catherine and Warrick fly there and meet that city's top CSI, Horatio Caine, who aids them in the investigation.

Note: This episode was used to introduce the cast of the future spin-off, _CSI: Miami._

## Quotes

**Sara:** Frat party. I wouldn't know anything about that ... How wild?
