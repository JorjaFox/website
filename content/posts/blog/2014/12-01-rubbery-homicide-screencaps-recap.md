Another good episode. _CSI_ has always done a decent job with kink. Interestingly, I'd watched _Kinky Boots_ right before this episode...

The downside? Well. This was kind of a Greg episode, but not really. If I did score for Greg, I'd have given in 4 stars. Since I score for Sara, it gets 3 and a sad recap, since there wasn't anything personal about Sara to really touch on. The best I can say is her jump to a theory reminds me of "Face Lift", and that's a nice shout back.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Rubbery_Homicide">Recap</a>: (3 of 5 stars)</li>

</ul>
Next week is "Let's Make a Deal" but it doesn't have Sara.
