Sadly, the video is restricted (and heavily watermarked) so I can't share screeencaps or clips at all. But I can give you a transcript, where Jorja talks about the 'work' of going to parties.
<blockquote><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10046" alt="Entertainment Weekly 6th Annual Pre-Emmy Party" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/03/2a0bc2f6-9c40-442a-b5f7-8e6c24138adenews.ap_.org_r620x349-250x250.jpg" width="275" height="120" />This is the work part! I know that it's hard to believe it, that this is part of the job. But if you're lucky. Once you get inside, it's not too work-y. It's really kind of social. And especially there are a lot of New Yorkers who are never here, that are here, and a couple Canadians, and the documentary people that are always wherever in Swazziland. It's cool to get to kind of hang out and celebrate your work. That you're lucky enough to be here and doing what you love.</blockquote>
