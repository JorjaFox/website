## Synopsis

Grissom and Sara are called to the crime scene when two murder victims are found hidden in pipes at a construction site in the middle of an alfalfa field, while Catherine and Nick investigate an ostensible hunting accident.

The investigation of the construction site murder reveals that the victims were sisters and the relationship of one of the sisters to a former prison inmate is a cause for suspicion -- especially when his presence is traced to the scene of the crime.

Meanwhile, Catherine and Nick begin to doubt seriously that the body found in the woods was the victim of a hunting accident.

## Review

Sara sees the similarities between herself and one of the sisters. As she questions the ex-con, Sara's comments seem to be more self-reflective than about the dead woman. At the end of this episode, Sara purges her apartment of mail-order magazines and food delivery menus -- all things that make her similar to the dead woman. After that, she calls up someone (interviews with the show's producers claim this is Hank) and asks him out.

## Notes

* Sara doesn't cook, and doesn't socialize much.
* Sara recognizes Grissom's basic misanthropic nature.
