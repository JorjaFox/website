## Question - about Sara Sidle(?)  

**Jorja Fox:** Uh, yes, well I think that Marg and I feel very very lucky to play the women we get to play on TV, you know. The character I get to play is "so" much smarter than I am, number one, "(laughs)" which is really fun, you never get tired of doing that, and they're just, you know they're strong women, and they're professional, they're completely intellectual and at the same time they feel very real, they feel like real people to me, they don't feel, feels like a person that somebody could actually be. You know sometimes you see movies and television, which is very entertaining, but it's, it's, it's sort of someone who is very, you know, the superhero or the perfect beautiful person and the life that they get to lead, and I think that Marg and I get to play people that regular people can identify with, they say "Oh, I could be that person" or "I could do that". Uh, that's a really wonderful thing to get to do.

## Question - about fan mail  

**Jorja Fox:** From time to time, yes, and from Japan, I've definitely received letters from Japan, which is really very wonderful. Um, I get a lot of letters from teenagers which is really nice. I think that when we started the show I thought we were going to get a lot of mail from jail, from prisoners "(laughs)", and mail sort of, I don't know, I thought the mail would be more eccentric than it's been. It's been, it's been really nice, supportive, very sort of sane fan mail. Which I would have never expected.

## Question - about the best episode(?)  

**Jorja Fox:** Uh, "A Bullet Runs Through It", and I believe they're from season six, and they're actually a two-parter episode, and there's a, a, an incident that happens in a low income neighborhood in Los Vegas and the cops swoop down on the event, and everyone's got a different visual idea of what they think happened. So the community is very angry at the police, the police are very angry at the community, and we spend, uh, two episodes almost finding out actually what happened at the crime. And um, I feel that it's, you know, it's a very timely episode, at least for us in America, I think this kind of thing happens a lot, there's a lot of distrust of police and authorities, a lot of people feel very disenfranchised, and of course we had Hurricane Katrina here last year, and there were a lot of citizens that felt like, uh, the people that are supposed to protect them really let them down, or never showed up, and um, and uh I also think that we live in a time where there's a lot of escalation of fear, and, and the idea that uh, you know, people are afraid of things, some of them rational, some aren't rational, and I think that people, at least in America, there's a very split situation happening politically, with a lot of people - we're talking about millions and millions of people - and, and they have very short tempers right now. So rather than sitting down and talking things through, they're leaping to anger very quickly and leaping to violence very quickly and, and that episode for me, has a lot of those issues and ideas in it, and I thought it was really beautifully written and kind of gutsy, we don't tell a lot of stories, we don't put a lot of moral, moral feelings into a lot of our stories, we sort of just tell a story and let people decide for themselves. And this one I think the writers couldn't help a little bit, they just put a little bit a sense of themselves into it, and that's sort of a brave way that I really liked a lot. "(listens to translator)" Yeah, yeah, I think it's really good. I think, you know, we'll see what happens in season seven but I think the most powerful episode to date's been that one.

##Question - about Sara and Grissom

**Jorja Fox:** "(laughing)" Sara and Grissom. Well you know Sara, coming into season five, kind of decided that she's not going to chase Grissom any more. I think she finally recognized after almost three, four years of chasing him around, and he's turned her down, and he's said 'no' to dates several times, she's decided that she's gonna try and move on, you know, and of course we all know that the ones that get away are sort of the ones that are definitely the hardest to forget and hardest to, to do that with. So, there's a bit of a struggle there, um, you know she's just trying, she's just trying to move on.

###Question - about William Petersen  

**Jorja Fox:** Uh, I think he'll be, ah, really overjoyed. He's incredibly charming, and, and wonderful, he's an amazing listener, creatively I think he's absolutely brilliant. When he, uh, started with "CSI" he had come from a theater background in Chicago, Illinois in the States and the only way that he really knows how to work is collectively and communally and where people develop ideas together, the stories together, and um he had kind of said to everyone at CBS, the writers, that, that's the way this show would have to be or else he wouldn't know how to work in this environ-, in that environment and so from the very beginning we had a very collective show, and it's pretty rare on television. And um, and the writers get together and they have think tanks and they break stories together and they work on stories together and even when sometimes, when the story gets to the set the writer, the actors, the director might still be discussing it, they might make changes on the set, and so it really makes working really fun and interesting, and also you have to stay on your toes because things you think are happening may not happen the way that you thought when you got to work. And, and he really brings that spirit to the set and everyone has, he listens to everyone, everyone has an opinion and they've got values and he's funny. He's, he's, you know, obviously he's my most favorite scene partner I've ever had and, um it's been really exciting to, to take this journey not only with everyone but specifically with him. And um, I think both he and I feel very very invested in the characters and we're wishing that our characters at some point "way" down the road have a happy ending somewhere, whatever that looks like.

##Question - Billy Petersen vs. Gil Grissom  

**Jorja Fox:** "(smiling)" Yeah, absolutely. "(listening to off-camera question)" Mmmm-hmmm. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely, and it does, it's the same. And he'll tell you that he has absolutely nothing at all in common with Grissom, and ah, some of us know that that's "(laughing)" not entirely true. Um, but yeah, just the professionalism, and, and the focus, he's tireless. You know, we would work, you know, many many many long hours, and especially in maybe our first three or four seasons of the show in almost every scene, no matter how tired he was, and, and how far into the season we were he would come into work and give 150%. And I think that also, everybody around him is very contagious, you know, to someone that has that kind of enthusiasm. Um, yeah, he's calm and very forgiving, you know, Grissom is certainly, and the other thing that's great about Grissom is he's always busy doing what he's doing, so he's not paying "too" much attention on the rest of us, we really get to go out and solve our own crimes, and, and that's cool too.
