Discovery will air <a href="http://racingextinction.com/">Racing Extinction</a> on December 2nd. So for those who have not been able to see the movie, you'll be able to watch it on cable.

I'm especially delighted because this will be one the first times I've seen Discovery air somethingÂ **pro** sharks! In general, Discovery hypes paranoia about sharks, making them seem pretty terrible. This is a change, and I hope it means more.
