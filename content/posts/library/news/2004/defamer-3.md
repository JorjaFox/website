* My friend and I sat next to **Jorja Fox** while dining at Eagle "Silverlake-in-Training" Rock vegetarian eatery Fatty's at about 2pm on Sunday. (which makes sense since Jorja is a well-known vegetarian.) She was with a female, Punky Brewster looking non-famous friend. Jorja wasn't wearing makeup, looking pretty, but very normal. She was dressed in a khaki sweater, black tshirt and jeans, Tall and very skinny in a non-anorexic, super metabolism way. She had a very lovely conversation with the owner, but looked very nervous and self-conscious, she clearly knew everyone in the restaurant knew who she was and was looking at her- i felt bad for her. Best of all, she ate a nice, big plate of real food- something hearty with eggs. Overall, she seemed very normal, friendly, and down to earth.
