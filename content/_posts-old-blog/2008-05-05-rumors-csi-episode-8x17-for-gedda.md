This post is open for talk about the <b>possibility</b> of Jorja showing up in the season finale of CSI.  Please note, this post is for spoilers, speculation and hearsay.  If anything substantive is made public, I'll let you know.<!--more-->

Here are the details as they have been made known.  Please remember, <b>NONE</b> of this is verified.  Emailing JFO asking for details will not endear you to anyone. We do not keep secrets.

<ol>
	<li>TV Guide listed Jorja as appearing in the finale (see <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jorja-fox/tv-listings/190228">here</a>)</li>
	<li>Jorja was spotted leaving the sound stages a few weeks ago</li>
</ol>

TV.com and IMdB are both fan updated sites, so their information cannot be used as confirmation.  If you hear something, please post it here with a link or some sort of evidence.  'A friend says...' doesn't count either, guys.

I am contacting my friends in the biz, and thus far have heard nothing.
