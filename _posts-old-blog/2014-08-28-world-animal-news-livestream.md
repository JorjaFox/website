This video _should_ be world wide... I hope. If not, leave comments and I'll see what can be done.

While Jorja _is_ in the first 45 minutes, she's not the focus of the interview. Still it's very interesting and they talk about _Blackfish_ and _Extinction Soup_ and some of the thoughts behind it. I won't be transcribing since she didn't talk that much and it would be very disjointed. I will try to get some screenshots.

I greatly appreciate that Jorja uses her fame to push issues like this. It's one of the myriad reasons I love running this site.
