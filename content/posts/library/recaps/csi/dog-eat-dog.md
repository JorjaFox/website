## Synopsis

Grissom and Catherine confront a case of a man with [Prader-Willi Syndrome](http://www.pwsausa.org/) who literally ate himself to death. Jerry Gable required constant supervision all his life, or he would eat non-stop. He lived with his sister, but when she went to the hospital for surgery, she left her boyfriend to watch Jerry. Jerry manipulated the boyfriend to take him to a buffet, where he chowed down at the buffet itself and was kicked out. The boyfriend hatched a plan to enter Jerry in an extreme eating contest, which Jerry came in third. But Jerry was still hungry and ran off, eventually eating himself to death.

Nick and Sara watch a divorce end with the death of both parties. Michael and Lori Tinsley fought over everything, from the house and the vinyl collection, to their dog Kahlua. Finally they agree to let the dog decide, and in the presence of a lawyer, both call the dog to them. Kahula chose Lori, however she cheated by rubbing bacon on her hands. Michael came back that night to swap out the real Kahula with a look-alike he'd bought at the shelter. Lori was home and confronted him, shooting him bizzarely up the nostril with her .22 caliber. The faux-Kahula was likely abused, and the loud noise set her off, causing her to rip out Lori's throat.

## Review

Sara and Nick are both sharp cookies on this case. While Nick follows the blood drops, Sara investigates the missing vinyl selection. Both determine that the missing albums, between the Beach Boys and Billy Joel can only be [The Beatles](http://www.beatles.com/).

After learning Michael was shot (there was no blood on the scene or an exit wound, the .22 lodged in his brain), Sara returns to the Tinsley House and deduces the gun was thrown when the dog attacked Lori. With little work, she finds it under the couch.

## Notes

* Sara appears to be happy she doesn't have to deal with divorce.

## Quotes

**Sara:** Divorces are war. Sure glad I don't have that problem.

**Sara:** That's like saying there was a second shooter on the grassy knoll, Nick! The Tinsley's only had one dog!
