## Synopsis

Langston testifies against the notorious 'Dick & Jane' killer, Nate Haskell.  The trial doesn't go well and is touch and go for a while. Haskell escapes with the help of the many women he's seduced to his cause.

Meanwhile, Nick receives a call from troubled teen Jason McCann  to warn him of impending danger. During the investigation, Catherine, Nick, Vartann and a bomb tech are trapped in a warehouse with a bomb. They manage to escape, but Vartann is seriously wounded. The CSIs track down Jason, only to learn he's not just working with the bombers, he's in charge of them.

## Review

Sara works in the lab, helping to determine who set the bomb up at Nick's. She traces down evidence pointing to Jason as the bomber, or at least associated with them. Sara is sympathetic to the boy, thinking his strings are being pulled.

## Notes

* Sara's advice to Ray is remembered, and used in court against Haskell.
