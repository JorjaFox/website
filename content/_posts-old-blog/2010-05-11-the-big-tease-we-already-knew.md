<blockquote><strong>Thanks for the story on all the possible ‘CSI‘ changes. I just hope that Jorja Fox sticks around, if only so we can get the full story on why Sara suddenly returned to the team. – <em>Craig</em></strong>
Stay tuned, because “all questions re: Sara Sidle will be answered,” series creator Anthony Zuiker said in a recent Variety chat.</blockquote>
