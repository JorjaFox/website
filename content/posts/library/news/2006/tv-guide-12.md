**You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara's relationship. We got 'em!**

William Petersen "and" Jorja Fox "tell all about CSI's biggest mystery yet"

**Las Vegas. Sin City.** The night was black as an oil patch left by a perp's getaway car, but the neon lights of the Strip cast a glow on the town tlike a rainbow on a bender. That's when we saw them ... Grissom and Sidle, two CSIs who had no business being in a bedrobe together. The dame wore a robe, like she'd just stepped out of the shower. And Grissom ... her boss ... lay on the bed, talking about death.

Turns out relationships that happen in Vegas don't always stay in Vegas. Here's the evidence: In the last scene of "CSI"'s May season finale, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) shocked viewers with their romantic rendezvous. Fan Web sites went nuts. TV GUIDE got lots of letters - some people liked the relationship; others wanted to send the storyline on a slow boat to China. We had to know: What were the producers thinking?

Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn came clean. This promises to be the most personal season of "CSI" yet. Good thing, too, since it's now going up against TV's sudsiest smash, "Grey's Anatomy". "The bones of Season 7 will be the toll the job has on our CSIs," she says. "The sin in Sin City is beginning to wear on them."

Next we talked to exec producers Naren Shankar: "We're not going to turn into a soap opera, but we're going to see their anger with the world, and them reaching out to each other."

Then they really sang like canaries: Turns out "all" the CSIs will get roughed up this season, in one way or another.

[...]

That's what we got. Now it's your turn. TV GUIDE sat down with Petersen and Fox to ask the "your" questions (collected on [tvguide.com](http://www.tvguide.com)) about all that's happened and what's still to come on "CSI".

**Does the fan response to this new relationship shock you?**

**William Petersen:** We knew there was a shock value to it because of the little bits and moments that Sara and Grissom have had over the years. So to see them together that way would have impact in terms of, "Whoa, there they are!"

**Jorja Fox:** I like the mystery of it. It left so many more questions than it really answered. And I think we're all going to figure that out as we go into this season. Billy and I aren't necessarily that far ahead of the audience with this one.

**How long have Grissom and Sara been seeing each other?**

**Fox:** We may find out more about that from time to time.

**Why do you think Grissom so coldly said no to a relationship in earlier seasons but decided to accept it now?**

**Petersen:** Obviously, this relationship is fraught with danger for Grissom. He and Sara have a mentor-protegee relationship and it'd be difficult for anyone in that situation. What one might say one day might not necessarily be how one feels. And what one ends up doing may not be what one thought he or she would be doing.

**Please, please, can we have a kiss before all is said and done?**

**Petersen:** "[Laughing]" I'd like to think we could. We'd love to kiss but the network would have to cough up some more money for that. Tongue would cost more. Sometimes they pay you for things that are fun.

**Mr. Petersen, what were you thinking when you chose to wear that aloha shirt in the Season 6 finale? Did the thought of being shirtless ever cross your mind?**

**Petersen:** Regarding being shirtless, it never crossed my mind. That aloha shirt has a history. I got it in the Philippines 10 years ago off a guy's back. I traded him shirts in the jungle. For Grissom, it was something different. This is how he lets his hair down when he's with someone he trusts.

**Fox:** Sure, Sara loves Grissom in the buff. But I don't think that was what the scene was about. One of my favorite things was Grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters. And maybe they go home after the things they've seen and have some tenderness of their own.

**Which character will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara's hidden romance?**

**Petersen:** Sara and Grissom are not going to let people find out, which makes it even more intense. I don't know who would find out first or how they'd react. I do know there are several actors dying to be the one who finds out. "[Laughs]" Paul Guilfoyle has already gone to the writers saying, "I'm the one who knows!"

**The chemistry between the entire group seems to be changing ... the bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why?**
**Fox:** I'm sorry the writer feels that way. The writer will be happy to find out there's some Warrick and Nick stuff coming up early in this season.

**Miss Fox, you play Sara so well, I wonder if you are like her?**

**Fox:** I am probably more like her than any other character I've played, which is lucky considering that this has been going on for six years. Billy swears that he's acting like Grissom, and that must be exhausting for you "[Petersen laughs]". I do like her a lot. She's much smarter than I am. But I also like to focus on one thing for a while. We have OCD in common. I'm very idealistic, like Sara.

**Do you think Lady Heather is Grissom's soul mate?**

**Petersen:** I think she's his spanking partner. Every now and then a guy needs a good spanking. Lady Heather could teach this country a lot. How to dress.

**Fox:** Definitely how to dress.

**Miss Fox, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather?**

**Fox:** It would be great if Lady Heather and Sara met. It would be a fun scene to do. When we go places that are sensual, sexual or a bit exotic or scandalous, Sara's never there. She's at the car-wash murder across town "[laughs]". So it is a pet peeve of mine that these episodes get written and I'm miles away. And I wonder if that's partially control on Grissom's part, since he hands out the cases.

**Now that you'll be going up against "Grey's Anatomy", will you be adding more story lines about the personal relationships on the show to attract some of the "Grey's Anatomy" fans?**

**Fox:** I wish them well. It's a great show and a lot of wonderful people are involved.
