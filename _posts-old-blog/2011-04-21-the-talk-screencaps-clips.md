So ... there wasn't a whole lot new to learn from _The Talk_, but Jorja looked great!  How great?

If you're in the US, and possibly Canada, you can watch clips from the show, which I've included below!  If not, screencaps are up at <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/talkshow/20110421-thetalk/">The Talk Gallery</a>

She talked about tipping (and that having worked in the service industry she tips well).  Julie Chen asked how much she tips, and Jorja says 20%.  Then Jorja explained she'd been a model, revealing that at 15, her mother had asked her to stop hanging out with some older kids and, as she was saying goodbye, they all entered the modeling contest which Jorja won and changed her life.  "Chubby Foxy Lady girl won a modeling contest!?"  Basically it was a cute fluff piece.  Something nice to hold us through to May 5th, which is the next time we get to see Sara Sidle.
