Here we are!  The end of Season Eleven.  Who will live, who will die, and who will be back next season?  Don't expect all the answers.
<h3>Official Release</h3>
After years of pursuit and a countless number of murders, Langston comes face-to-face with serial killer Nate Haskell inside the house where his killing spree began. Langston finally vanquishes his longtime nemesis Nate Haskell, but the question remains, will I.A. pronounce the kill a righteous one?

<h3>Recap</h3>
<del>Coming Soon!</del>

That's three stars for Sara.  She was very true to herself, and to how much Sara has grown.  It was like she was channeling Grissom.  Very much appreciated.  Here's her best quote of the night (when asked by Greg if she would have investigated Greg as much as she is Ray):
<blockquote>We have all had a moment in the dark, where we had to fight our way out, and when we did, it was up to the rest of the team to shine a light on that darkness to see what happened. That's our job. I just need to know what I'm dealing with, and then I will deal with it.</blockquote>
Basically, ignore all the Ray drama stuff and it's a great episode with science and deduction.  The Ray drama bored me, and I really hope they start next season, sweeping this under the rug.  Oh, yeah, we end on a mild cliffhanger of how will Ray please to the killing of Haskell: Self Defense or Murder.
