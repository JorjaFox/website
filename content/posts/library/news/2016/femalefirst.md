Jorja Fox of CSI fame celebrates her birthday today, so we take a look at how she spends her time off screen promoting plant based living.

She has been a vegetarian since she was 19, an aspiring vegan and has worked with PETA to help highlight the benefits of going veggie. She has also worked with ADI to inform people of the cruelty that goes on in circuses around the globe.

The Montreal vegan company Matt and Natt even named a purse after her for her efforts to showcase meat free living.

Fox read at the Los Angeles book launch of Karen Dawn's Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way we Treat Animals and also told Access Hollywood how being veggie helps the environment.

Every year she is nominated for the World's Sexiest Vegetarian.

_'I can see myself in a snail or a whale. It's easy, actually. My empathy and compassion for the human condition came first, and then it expanded.' (IMDB)_

Happy Birthday Jorja!
