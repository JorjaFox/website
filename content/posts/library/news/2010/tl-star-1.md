***CSI*'s Jorja Fox says she wasn't sure to re-sign**

Asked by the weekly French magazine Tele Star, Jorja Fox talked about the season 11 of *CSI*. She re-signed for 11 episodes and will see in early 2011 if she wants to do more. Making only a few episodes works for her.

She wasn't sure about returning to the show. Since 12 years now she has been working on television series, including *ER* and *CSI*, and she started to lose energy. She was afraid that people see it on screen.

She decided to return this season because she felt like the whole cast and the writers were really behind the show. As for CBS refusing to give the actors a pay raise, she replies that not only the actors are concerned about it but also the crew. *"All the Americans are touched by the financial crisis so we must tighten our belts too."*
