## Synopsis

Keppler's past comes back to haunt him. Plagued by nightmares, Keppler's father in law, Frank McCarty, comes to Vegas and asks Keppler for help. Retired Trenton cop, Dennis Graves, is going to turn them all in for the murder of a Puerto Rican drug dealer back in Trenton. Keppler had shot the dealer in retaliation for the rape of his fiancee, Amy, who was also Frank's daughter. Frank then leaves the murder weapon for both Dennis' death and the Puerto Ricans in his hotel room, knowing that it has Keppler's prints on it. Keppler learns that it was Frank who raped Amy, thus causing her to commit suicide, and goes after him. The two face off with the witness to Dennis' murder in the room, and Frank and Keppler kill each other.

Grissom returns and after avoiding paperwork, settles in to help the CSI's bring in Keppler.

## Review

Sara returns from investigating a garbage dump and runs into Grissom at the lab. To a degree, they have traded places in their relationship, with Grissom now being forward and affectionate, but Sara is avoiding him somewhat, citing her smell from being at the dump. Grissom says Sara will be surprised to see what the cocoon hatches.

Sara and Catherine check out the witness' apartment, while the other CSIs are searching for her.

## Notes

* Sara is somewhat distant towards Grissom.
* In "Bully for You", Sara's hair follicles had absorbed the smell of the liquefied man, causing her to 'smell', and making Hank Peddigrew back away. In this episode, Sara has returned from a garbage dump, smelling bad, and this time backs away from Grissom.

## Quotes

**Sara:** You know, some women live out of their purses. [...] I think we just found her office.

**Grissom:** I'll see you later.
**Sara:** Yeah, you will.
