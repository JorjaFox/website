But yesterday was <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/csi-paul-guilfoyle-exit-690751">Paul's last day ever</a> (please read the link _before_ you ask questions, or you make CSIs sad - also, all **I** know is what's in the news). The amount of sad I have right now cannot be measured.
