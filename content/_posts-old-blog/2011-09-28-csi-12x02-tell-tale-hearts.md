<h3>Recap</h3>
Coming 'soon'. I'm out of town till the weekend, so I'll be late!  If you guys want to fill it in down in the comments, have at!  Until then, settle for some spoilers from the CSI Mole:
<blockquote>John seemingly normal looking, but is he simply a creepy, immature peeping Tom? This sheltered man-boy is the prime suspect in the brutal slaughter of an entire family. Shaking, nervous, ready to confess to anything after being interrogated, John, it seems, had a strange fascination with his neighbor's little girl.

Ms. Gitig on the surface is a pretty, very put together, straight forward, icy, no nonsense, paralegal, but under the facade she's truly crazy and the mastermind of the murders. Seemingly privy to information known only to the police and the killer she confesses to a gruesome multiple killing. Ms. Gitig, seems an unlikely suspect to have carried out such a brutal attack.

Alison is necking in the car with her boyfriend Matt, she's startled as the vehicle is splashed with a mixture of water and blood.</blockquote>
