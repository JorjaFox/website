Her donation of $50 is why you get <strong>150</strong> screencaps of the Pilot of <strong>Missing Persons</strong>!  The numbers were not planned, it just sort of happened that way!

I admit, rewatching this episode brought up the old discussions about the show. Like how odd it was to watch Jorja play a shy, nervous, 'weak' character.  I'm spoiled!  Most of her characters are strong women, but Connie's really just a young girl in a man's world, and Jorja plays the part perfectly!

Okay, next donation gets you a video clip from this episode.  The one where she's flashing her badge.
