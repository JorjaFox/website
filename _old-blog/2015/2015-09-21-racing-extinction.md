Before we say goodbye to CSI, let's talk about _not_ saying goodbye to animals.

Come and watch the new documentary, RACING EXTINCTION from Academy Award winning director of The Cove, Louie Psihoyos, with your Shark Allies friends this Wednesday, Sept. 23rd at Laemmle NoHo at 7:10pm.

This eye-opening film will captivate and inspire you. Our Wednesday screening will be sure to bring together an interesting bunch of people and your attendance will help Shark Allies.

Panel discussion with shark experts and representatives of the film will take place right after the film.
