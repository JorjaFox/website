This time you have to put up with me translating, so I'm VERY sorry for the poor quality. JFO Detective Captain <a href="https://jorjafox.net/members/ninizik/">Veji_Ninizik</a> scanned in the full interview with Jorja, which I typed up and translated and posted on the wiki.  At the bottom of this post is the scan of the full article, in French. If you can clean up my translation, you too can get funny titles on JFO!

Jorja will decide in January if she wants to do more than 11 episodes. This doesn't mean she's in all eleven on the beginning, just that she's contracted for 11 episodes.

Also Jorja spoke about Liz leaving the show:
<blockquote>After William Petersen (Grissom) and Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), it is time for the character of Wendy Simms (one of the heroines often confined to the laboratory) to disappear from the series. Liz Vassey has indeed been thanked by the production. It's a great dissapointment to Jorja Fox: "I am very disappointed. Liz, Marg and I were the only heroines. We wanted to look for more women, it's sad."</blockquote>
