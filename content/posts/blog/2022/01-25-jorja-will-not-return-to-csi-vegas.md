Jorja announced on Twitter that she **will not** be returning to _CSI: Vegas_

{{< twitter user="JorjaFoxofficia" id="1486014897947385857" >}}

Her summation "So goes Grissomâ€¦..So goes Sara. Wherever they go, they belong together." is the greatest testament to her deep understanding of both what made the show a success, and why they need to be together.</p>

What does that mean here? Not a whole lot! Just won't be scrambling to recap/screencap.

I am in full support of her choice and can't wait to see what she does next.
