Philippe Cousteau, grandson Jaques Cousteau, went to Hollywood last Thursday (July 15th) to talk about the Gulf Oil spill, and how it affects the environment.

"Philippe offered his unique insight into the disaster and suggested ways for members of the entertainment community to assist with the recovery efforts," said Steve Ross, executive director of the Artists and Athletes Alliance.

In attendance, besides Jorja Fox, was Eric Szmanda and David Berman.

If pictures become available, I'll post them.

As a reminder, JFO is raising money now through September 1st to help clean up the Gulf spill.  Money will be donated, in Jorja's name, to the Surfrider foundation. You can read about the details at <a href="https://jorjafox.net/birthday">https://jorjafox.net/birthday</a>.
