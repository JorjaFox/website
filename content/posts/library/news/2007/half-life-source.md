**The TV hit series CSI will lose Jorja Fox as one of their starring actors.**

Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on "CSI," is leaving the show to pursue other opportunities. Fox has been on the show since it premiered in 2000.

Fox first broke the news in October that she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities before she gets too old.

It's not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. Even so, whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves CSI's Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama.

Surprisingly, most fans are happy with the departure. Others feel the production will decline in ratings because of the solid cast behind the popular series.

CSI fans are split, some have called the character pathetic and that Fox is too dramatic that whines all the time. Others feel the show will suffer because Fox is good to look at.

While Jorja Fox is no George Clooney, she may be weighing on something much bigger than CSI. There could be a movie in the works and leaving CSI doesn't mean the sudden end to her successful career. Tom Hanks was recognized on a TV series before making impressive movies. That was a good career move.

Fox is a good actor, she'll be back.
