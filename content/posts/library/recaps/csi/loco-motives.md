## Synopsis

A man is found, waist deep in cement, after having tried to toss a body to sink into the cement, only to find it had hardened too much. Brass, Catherine and Grissom find the predicament very funny. The man refuses to say anything informative, and the woman was killed by a stab wound to the heart. It turns out the case is connected to another. Warrick and Nick work the case of an elderly woman, beaten in the head, and staged with her head in an oven. Lime Jell-O is found at the crime scene as well as in an empty sublet across the alley from her apartment. The man is IDd by the young girl babysat by one of the woman, who saw him cleaning up the mess. Max killed his wife and then their neighbor both by a phenomenal series of accidents in one of the worst days of anyone's life.

Another man is found dead at a poultry plant, and a miniature crime scene is found nearby. Sara and Grissom go over the model and find a third picture of a dead doll. The owner of the plant was the target of an anti-cruelty campaign by Izzy Delancy. After tracking some of the miniature parts, the CSIs determine Ernie Dell, a worker at the plant, is a miniature railroad aficionado. At his home, they find a variety of miniatures, many including depictions of murders. While Ernie's miniature molds connect him to the crimes, he sells them and is thus let go. Later, a cell phone is tied to Ernie, and as the police go to arrest him, he kills himself on a live video feed, watched by Grissom, having sent an email confessing to the crimes.

## Review

Sara works with Grissom and uncovers Izzy Delancy's anti-cruelty video. Her relationship with Grissom has progressed to where they can openly tease each other. She manages to track the cellphone number in common with both Izzy Delancy and Penny Garden, which had recently had minutes added to it by Ernie Dell.

## Notes

* Sara is still a vegetarian.

## Quotes

**Sara:** You look like the kid who just found the prize in the bottom of a Cracker Jacks box.
