Though perhaps not _that_ kind of story. Jorja will be performing in "The Vagina Monologues" on Friday, May 16th, with V-Day. You can buy tickets from <a href="http://www.vdayatwater.com/tickets.htm">V-Day Atwater and Ensemble Studio Theatre Los Angeles</a>, and Jorja will _only_ be there on Friday at 8pm!
