I have a surprising ton of CSI swag in my house. I have three large frames, two small ones, a poster board, four shirts, two hats, and one poster. No. Really:

Now I've never been the collecting kind. I don't even own the CSI box sets. So where did I get these?

From Jorja.

No, really. She contacted me, asking if I knew anyone who wanted this stuff. Yes, she knows I'm not into collecting. I said I could use it to raise money for charity and asked if she'd make a video for you guys so you'd know this is the real deal.

So now I have all this stuff and, as I catalogued it, I realized I _might_ be in over my head. I had no idea how to ship these things. My original plan was to just offer these as perks or rewards for donation via something like GoFundMe. Then I got them weighed and estimated at FedEx (looks like about $40 for shipping the big ones across the US) and did the only thing logical.

I went to eBay.

Here's how this will work!

The items are all up on eBay, with a low-price, and you guys can bid all you want. You have 10 (ten) days for everything. You'll be paying for your own shipping, and I'm sorry about that, but it's just expensive and I can't afford to pro-bono the shipping like I'd planned. This is sad, but it's also awesome because now it means I can ship international. Hey, you want to spring for it, you got it.

The money will all go to charity though. Surfrider. For Jorja's birthday. In fact, to make this even easier, I set up the sales via eBay's charity auctions. 95% of it all goes to Surfrider. 5% covers my costs (packaging, fuel, etc). And since it's a donation, your purchase is tax deductible. Win win!

I'm going to sell them in batches. First the small stuff, then the huge pictures, because I'm in the middle of traveling for conferences.
