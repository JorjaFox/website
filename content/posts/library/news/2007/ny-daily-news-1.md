The eighth season of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" traverses a tense path that long-time fans of the show will find familiar: a race-against-time CSI team effort to find one of their own, left to die in the desert by a vengeful killer.

Last time this happened, the intended victim was Nick (George Eads), buried alive - but eventually rescued - in an episode directed by Quentin Tarantino. This time, Nick is one of the team members using all his skills and instincts to help his colleague, Sara (Jorja Fox), escape a similar fate.

Technically, Sara escaped death once already. Her character was supposed to die in the very first episode, but test audiences responded so positively to Fox's performance that the producers decided to let Sara live. Sara also upped her status in last season's finale, when Grissom (William Petersen), upset by Sara's disappearance and apparent abduction, made public his affection for her.

Tonight, the questions posed are these:

Will the "miniature killer," whose identity was revealed in May as a female janitor who worked in the CSI lab, crack under interrogation and reveal the location where she "posed" Sara in a life-threatening tableau?

Will the CSI team find her, when the only obvious clue is the serial killer's taunting miniature model showing that Sara is pinned under an overturned car somewhere in the desert?

If and when they find her, will she still be alive?

Finally, how did the killer manage to arrange such a complex, creepy presentation in the first place?

The answer to the first question is a quick "No" - otherwise, there'd be no drama the rest of the hour.

For the other answers, watch for yourself. Facts are doled out slowly, but surely, in a clever narrative that intercuts the present (the search for Sara) with the past (how she was abducted and posed, and what happened next).

The flash-flood element of the story seems to come and go a bit too quickly, especially in visual terms, but the entire hour is paced so quickly, you hardly notice. It's a good start for a new season of "CSI," the granddaddy and still quality champion of the "CSI" franchise.
