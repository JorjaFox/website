## Synopsis

Ryan Lester is a porn producer, killed in the tub similarly to the Paul Millander killings   in a relatively upscale Vegas area. The economic downturn has led to more renters and people of shadier incomes. The investigation leads them to a peeping tom by the name of Craig Mason, adopted son of Judge Mason (aka Paul Millander), now a teenaged goth with a penchant to heavy metal music. They find a second body, his throat slit similarly to Lester, but on the ground outside his house, which he's using as a drug house. The Mason's house is in between the porn house and the drug house. Both men were killed within the same period of time, by the same weapon. Ray feels that none of the other CSIs are able to be unbiased regarding Craig, and after performing an experiment with him, proves Craig didn't commit the murders. Sara and Nick go back over the evidence and determine the captain of the neighborhood watch performed the killing, in an attempt to clean up the neighborhood.

Ray and Doc Robbins find a backlogged corpse with a surprise inside: his small intestine is died green and tied around his spleen. The man died of natural causes, and the body shows no sign of incisions. They suspect it was done laparoscopically but Ray finds it difficult to duplicate those results. Nicknaming the killer Dr. Jekyll, they determine he took the corpse' bow tie, and suspect they will see his handiwork again.

## Review

Sara and Nick are the first CSIs on the scene for Ryan Lester. While inspecting Craig Mason's room, Sara recognizes the horror mask made by Paul , as well as the fake hand. When Nick tells her Craig's full name, Sara connects him to the split personality serial killer. Sara attempts to connect with Craig, over their similarly traumatic past, but he hates all CSIs and refuses to cooperate.

Sara apologizes to Craig before they release him. Craig confesses that he never knew Paul Millander, as his father would take him to Hollowierd and told him that Mr. Millander owned it. He loved the idea of Paul Millander, never knowing that Paul was his father. When Craig is released, his mother doesn't come to pick him up, so Sara takes him home.

## Notes

* Sara refers to herself as 'Mrs. Grissom', in jest, and denies that she's taken his name.
* Sara is happy to see David Phillips, the coroner.
* Sara loved the band Black Sabbath for a summer.
