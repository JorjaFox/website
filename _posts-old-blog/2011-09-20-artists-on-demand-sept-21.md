<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3816" title="Artists on Demand" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/09/artistsondemand-230x154.png" alt="" width="230" height="154" />Set your radios!  Jorja will be on <a href="http://artistsondemandonline.com/">Artists on Demand</a> on Wednesday, September 21st, to promote CSI!

<a href=" http://www.blogtalkradio.com/artistsondemandradio/2011/09/21/jorja-fox">You'll be able to listen to Artists on Demand Radio at blog talk radio</a> - Airtime is 2:30pm ET, so adjust as needed. If you do not use the link there, you won't get in!

If you want to call in live and speak with the host, be sure to dial 347-884-9941. You will be placed into the caller queue where you will still be able to hear the show while you are on hold.

I won't be able to listen to it, thanks to my office's new block on internet radio, so if one of you can jump in and help transcribe/recap I'd appreciate it!
