I lived in California for a decade, but I've always lived on a 'coast' (be it Lake Erie or Lake Michigan).  There's a certain affinity we all have with water.  We need it to survive for one, but also there's a quiet beauty with water.  Water animals, salt or fresh, inspire us in ways we'd never have thought possible.

While I bike a lot (5 days a week, commuting) I also am now a driving individual.  I got a hybrid not just because I'm a bit of an eco-freak, but because I strongly feel we need to find alternative forms of energy.  We'll probably never get away from the need for oil for lubrication, but if we can get away from it for fuel, we can use a lot less.  And, yes, I use BP Gas.

<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/06/Washing_oiled_Gannet-Close.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/06/Washing_oiled_Gannet-Close-133x200.jpg" alt="" title="Washing_oiled_Gannetâ€“Close" width="133" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2479" /></a> This summer, for Jorja's birthday, I've decided JFO will raise money to help clean up the Gulf of Mexico from the horrific oil spill caused by BP's Deepwater Horizon pumping station.  To do so, all money donated between today and September 1st will be donated to <a href="http://www.surfrider.org/">The Surfrider Foundation</a>.

I'm not offering you guys any incentives other than a chance to help do the right thing and help the environment. I have this silly idea of taping video updates of what's going on, but really, I don't have to tell you how bad the spill is, or what's being done to fix it.  The money raised will help clean the water and the animals affected by the spill.  It will also help push the US government to limit (if not stop) oil drilling, and support cleaner energy efforts.

You in?  This donate link will take you to the JFO fundraiser page for the oil spill.  Donate if you can, and if not, spread the word.
