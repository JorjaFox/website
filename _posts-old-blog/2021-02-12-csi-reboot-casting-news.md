From TV Line comes the news that the <em>CSI</em> reboot is still on the table, and three more actors have been cast to join William Petersen and Jorja Fox.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Although reps for CBS and CBS Studios declined to comment, TVLine has learned that Matt Lauria (<em>Friday Night Lights, Kingdom</em>), Paula Newsome (<em>Chicago Med, Barry</em>) and Mel Rodriguez (<em>Last Man on Earth</em>) have joined the potential event series, which has yet to snag a formal pickup at the Eye network.Lauria will play Josh, a Level 3 CSI who excels at crime scene reconstruction, while Newsome will portray Maxine, the new head of the Vegas Crime lab. Rodriguez will play Hugo, the head medical examiner who has a slightly creepy obsession with dead bodies. Two additional roles are still being cast.<cite><a href="https://tvline.com/2021/02/12/csi-reboot-cast-matt-lauria-paula-newsome-cbs/"><em>CSI</em> Revival: Matt Lauria, Mel Rodriguez and Paula Newsome Join CBS' In-the-Works Sequel Series</a> - Michael Ausiello, TV Line</cite></blockquote>

It's important to remember that this is still not confirmed by CBS and the show has **not** been officially picked up by CBS. However it is known that there is a script out there, and the original plan was purported to be airing last year, to coincide with the 20th anniversary. Covid kinda messed that one up.

How do you feel about a return to <em>CSI</em>? How would you explain Grissom and Sara coming back?
