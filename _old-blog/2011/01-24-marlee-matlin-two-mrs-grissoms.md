I'd quote, but let's just go over what we learn:

&bull; Sara _did not_ know about Julia (Marlee) before hand.
&bull; Sara has been trying to forge a relationship with Grissoms' mom off camera (hence the learning of ASL).
&bull; Sara and Betty don't get along ("there have been looks that could kill" says Jorja).
&bull; Jorja talked to Billy about the episode beforehand.
&bull; Nick sucks up to Betty ("Nick likes seeing Sara in an awkward and precarious position.").

Oh fine, here's a quote that made me laugh:
<blockquote>“I think I have the proficiency of a clam right now,” says Fox of her ASL chops. “I’m hoping to work my way up to squirrel by the time we finish this episode. It’s sure something I’d like to continue with.</blockquote>
