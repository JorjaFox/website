The IMPACT FILM FUND (IFF) is a Washington, DC-based non-profit organization that was created as a platform for documentary and narrative filmmaking to engage with the political and policy arena of our nation's capital. IFF elevates the themes and topics in these films through screenings, panel discussions, promotional events and the press to educate and enlighten its audiences and create a climate for meaningful social impact.
