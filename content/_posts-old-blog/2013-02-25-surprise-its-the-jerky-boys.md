I didn't watch the movie.

I'm sorry, but for two scenes of less than 3 minutes, I'm not watching this movie. The recap is about as much as I got out of what I did watch, and the rest is from other people's reviews.

But. I did get a higher quality of video recently (thank you internet!) so you get higher quality screenshots of Jorja being a call girl.

Maybe if I can bear it, I'll video clip the two scenes.
