Anthony Zuiker has not been shy on Twitter, expressing his thoughts about the finale and Jorja.

And then he asked such a dangerous question...

I just said "Divorced" and linked him to the Wiki about the last couple seasons. If you do reply, please be polite and don't harangue him about how everything's ruined. We get two hours. Inspire him to write something <em>brilliant</em>, don't make him think you hate him or CSI.

But there are things we know. Like Marg told us:

> “I'm eager to see what this script will be because Billy [William] Petersen is apparently working with Anthony Zuiker, who created the show, on the story,” Helgenberger said. “Billy's got great taste and he's a smart guy. I'm happy to get in the ring with him because it's been a long time.”

That's two people, Jorja and Marg, calling this "One More For The Road" so I wonder if that's actually the title of the movie.
