The albums are listed chronologically, but the new ones are labeled as (you guessed it) new!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20010100-natpe/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="NATPE 2001" title="NATPE 2001" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/csi/20010100-natpe/natpe-02_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> **NEW!** In 2001, the cast of CSI attended to **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20010100-natpe">National Association of Television Production Executives</a>**, aka the <a href="http://www.natpe.org/natpe/">NATPE</a>, which is kind of like a Comic Con for TV people, where they show you everything that's being pushed for syndication in the next season.  SFTV's recap explains it better.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20020513-emmy/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="emmy_25" title="emmy_25" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/csi/20020513-emmy/emmy_25_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> Then in 2002, Billy, Jorja, Gary and Marg went to **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20020513-emmy">The Academy of TV Arts & Sciences Activities Committee</a>** for a behind the scenes presentation on CSI. The new images here start with the 17th picture.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20021015-csimiami/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="CSI: Miami Press Conference" title="CSI: Miami Press Conference" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/csi/20021015-csimiami/pressconf-01_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> **NEW!** Later on that year, Marg and Jorja went to the **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20021015-csimiami">CSI:Miami Press Conference</a>** for CSI:Miami's first season.  These images are often confused with the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/model/20021015-ssa">modeling pics for Shooting Star Magazine</a>. Even though they were taken at the same time, one set was just because Jorja and Marg were there, and the other was for a magazine about the press conference.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20031213-bellagio/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="Bellagio Party" title="Bellagio Party" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/csi/20031213-bellagio/bellagio_01_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> They capped off 2003 with a **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20031213-bellagio/">Party at the Bellagio</a>**, to celebrate being the number one show on TV. Gary, George, Marg, Jorja and Paul had a blast, and you'll see the producers for CSI there as well. The first four images in this batch are new.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20041112-100thep/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="csi100-41" title="csi100-41" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/csi/20041112-100thep/csi100-41_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> The **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/csi/20041112-100thep/">100th episode party</a>** was held in Las Vegas, as the usual gang was out in force to drink, gamble, and otherwise celebrate their achievement. Four new pictures (the last four) show Marg and Jorja having a go at the Blackjack table.<br style="clear:both;" />

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/advocacy/20050700-ada/"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb alignleft" alt="sag-ada15-30" title="sag-ada15-30" src="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/cache/pub/advocacy/20050700-ada/sag-ada15-30_200_cw200_ch200_thumb.jpg" /></a> And finally, in July of 2005, Jorja, Marg, Billy, Wallace Langham and David Berman went to the **<a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pub/advocacy/20050700-ada/">15th Anniversary of Performers with Disabilities Act</a>**, in support of presenter, and fellow _CSI_ actor, Robert David Hall.  After a car accident, Hall lost one leg above the knee and the other below, but this has never affected his acting career.<br style="clear:both;" />
