## Synopsis

The hunt for a deadly stalker is the focus of a tense episode that builds to a nail-biting conclusion. Jane Galloway lives in fear. Her doors are triple-locked. Every shade is drawn. The bathroom window is nailed shut. An alarm system is activated. But none of Jane's precautions keep a stalker from killing her. When the CSIs arrive at the scene, they discover the victim with her hair dyed and her face shoved in a toilet. The sickening image hits a nerve for Nick, but he's unsure why. And the case leaves the team with two mysteries to address: Who killed Jane, and how could the murderer have possibly entered, and left, the house?
