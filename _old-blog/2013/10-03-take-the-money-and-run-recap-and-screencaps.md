They kept adding layers and layers to the crime. Sara had some good scenes, and I really liked when Hodges and Henry were ... well ... it wasn't flirting, but they were totally trying to be nice and cheer her up. I guess she's forgiven about the whole divorce-- No, wait, it's a separation.

Anywho! I liked the episode. It was straightforward classic style CSI.

Funny story for you. I went to boarding school, and my senior year there was a kid who got meningitis. It's pretty nasty, so we all took the meds. Problem was the sports teams got in late that night, and while all the seniors had been told (since we had to help distribute the meds and make sure everyone took them), the underclassmen did not know about the side effects. The next morning, I remember the screams from people who were peeing orange. I also remember the weeks of double-washing all our clothes, because of the orange sweat.

Good times, good times.

Not good times? The last two hours fixing my own ham-handed idiocy with the gallery. Oy.
