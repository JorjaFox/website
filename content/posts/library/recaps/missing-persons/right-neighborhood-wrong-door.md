## Synopsis

Bobby helps his mother with a private matter when a member of her church goes missing. Connie looks into habitual runaway and train hopper, Joey Pender (age 8). Johnny looks into a missing rich Lake Shore Drive accountant.

## Review

While Joey has hopped on busses and trains before, he always turns himself in at the Kedzie station. His father is a long-distance truck driver, and since his mother makes a big deal about when his father comes home, Joey decided the best way to get attention was to go away. This time he's been out all night. Connie tracks Joey down to the A-train line and canvasses all the stations, as well as searching his house.

Joey's favorite toy truck is missing from the house, but they find his favorite hat in lost-and-found. The CTA worker who found the hat explains Joey dropped it when he was woken up and ran off at the end of the train line: O'Hare. Connie works with the police at O'Hare and, since she knows what time the train arrived at O'Hare, they're able to follow him on the surveillance tapes and find Joey snuck onto a plane to LA.
