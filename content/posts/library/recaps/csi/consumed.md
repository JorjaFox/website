## Synopsis

A somewhat disturbed man named Owen Linder claims he was abducted and a hunk of flesh cut off his leg and eaten in front of him. While Nick and Greg are dismissive, Dr. Robbins is not. After all, he's got a partly eaten arm in the morgue with the same wound pattern as Owen. Not only is Owen telling the truth, and is a member of 'Vore' culture (vorarephilia -- aka people who get off on eating/being eaten by other people), he knows the arm's owner: Dennis Hagel.

Dennis worked in endoscopy, and Owen shares a video of a woman (Miss Feed) who lets herself be 'scoped for voyeurs. Mid video, she's stabbed to death through her stomach. Morgan Brody and Sara review the video and ID the woman as Brenda Waring. When they go to her home, Brenda and Dennis' partly consumed bodies are still in her video room.

Nick and Finn go to a Vore party where they find nothing but roleplayers, but Gary Korloff, the host, has the same family crest as that which is on the knife that killed Brenda. Gary, however, prefers to be eaten than to eat, and gave the knife to a 'dark soul' he met online, known as The Eater. Brenda was helping Gary quit the Eater, and when Gary told him, it did not end well.

Between Gary and Owen's interviews, the CSIs trace the location of the Eater's 'dining room' to Bell Organic Pesticides, which closed in 2011. The knife is there, but no prints or DNA. The sketch is shared with the news, and a security guard claims to have arrested the guy. Only when he leaves the man alone in the car (handcuffed), he ... eats his way out.

However the hand is not one that was recently chewed off. The security guard was a liar, Todd Burris claims the hand was given to him by the Eater, who sucked him in with his aura. And then Todd dies from cyanide poisoning, in interrogation. Among Todd's belongings are mementos from Brenda and Dennis.

Gary swears that Todd was not the Eater, but the CSIs are split. Todd, perhaps, was the Eater, killing himself to let his legend live on. Or perhaps he was not. We'll never know.

## Review

Sara works first the video angel, then Brenda's home, and finally Bell Organic Pesticides' location.

Sara, the vegetarian, noticed that Brenda ate a jelly donut wrapped around a hamburger, based on the evidence in her stomach.

## Notes

* Sara knows about the bizarre Hangover Grill.

## Quotes

**Sidle**: The tale of the cannibal who eats through his own wrist just to escape. That's boogeyman level stuff.
