**JORJA FOX RETURNS TO CSI!**

LOS ANGELES, July 20 - SAG Award winner and fan favorite Jorja Fox will reprise her role as Sara Sidle on multiple episodes of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION this fall, airing Thursdays (9:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.

"We're thrilled for Jorja's return to CSI," said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. "The viewers and longtime CSI fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode."

CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, which returns for its 10th season this fall, was last season's number one drama. Fox, who had been a series regular since the show's first season, left during its eighth season, when her character, Sara, suffering job burnout, decided to leave the crime lab to deal with past demons. She returned briefly during season nine and then left again to do research in Costa Rica, where her former boss and romantic partner, Gil Grissom, later joined her.
