<span class="alignright">[polldaddy poll=2181364]</span> I hope the ads interest you enough that you click on them to check them out, as they are our primary source of income and keeps the site moving and ensure I don't have to beg for donations.  Oh and it's not just you, I 'renamed' the State of the Unions into 'Monthly Roundup' since we now have news fairly regularly.

<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/10/october-roundup-100x100.jpg" alt="october-roundup" title="october-roundup" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2090" /> October was Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  JFO supports the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation</a> and I ask that all of you to everything you can to increase your chances for survival.  Regular breast self-exams and, if you're higher risk, mammograms.  Because of that, JFO's been sporting a page-curl all month to remind you to check yourself and (if you can) donate.  A lot of companies are passing along funds if you buy their products (like Yoplait and Caribou Coffee) so if you can't outright donate, try to buy something that contributes for you.

**CSI**
We all heard the news halfway through the month (and if you didn't, you REALLY need to visit here more often!).  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/14/sara-sidles-in-semi-permanently/">Jorja's sticking on CSI **indefinitely**</a>.  For those of you too lazy to Google (or crack open a dictionary), that means "until you hear otherwise."

Jorja was on the following CSI episodes this month:
<ul>
	<li>10x02 "Ghost Town" (Oct 1) - <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/01/csi-10x02-ghost-town-recap-and-images/">discussion post</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season10/ghosttown/">gallery</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Ghost_Town">recap</a></li>
	<li>10x04 "Coup de Grace" (Oct 15) - <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/15/csi-ep-10x04-coup-de-grace/">discussion post</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season10/coupdegrace/">gallery</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Coup_de_Grace">recap</a></li>
	<li>10x05 "Bloodsport" (Oct 29) - <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/29/csi-10x05-bloodsport/">discussion post</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season10/bloodsport/">gallery</a> &bull; <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Bloodsport">recap</a></li>
</ul>

Coming up in November, we already know Sara will be in episode 10x6 (Death and the Maiden) and 10x08 (Lover's Lanes).  But that's November!  This is October!

**Jorja News Roundup!**
Jorja Fox will be acting as an <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/12/jorja-fox-executive-producer/">executive producer for a documentary series "Black Market"</a>. Also the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/13/skin-trade-theatrical-trailer/">trailer for "Skin Trade" was released</a> and Jorja stepped up to ask people to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/20/save-the-seals/">Save the Seals</a> in Canada.  The fellow who made the gang tracking software used in "Coup de Grace" (yes, it's real!) managed to <a href="https://jorjafox.net/2009/10/28/software-tracking-gangs-that-was-real-almost/">get a photo snapped with Jorja while on set</a>. Lucky guy!

You can see all the articles we've re-posted here under <a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/News_Articles_%282009%29#October">October 2009</a> (which includes the gay/lesbian French magazine Têtu who loves Jorja too!).
