_The New York Times had run a story saying that Jorja would be appearing on the show "The Bachelorette" - she joked about in on "The View"._

**Meredith:** Welcome to "The View", live from L.A. "CSI:" star Jorja Fox is our celebrity co-host today. Welcome to you, you look great.

**Jorja Fox:** Thank you so much. I feel like I'm in New York City right now, being with you guys, which is so nice for me, cause I'm from there-

**Joy:** Tell them about your name, "Jorja".

**Jorja Fox:** My name's Jorja-

**Joy:** Tell them how you spell it - J-O-R-J-A.

**Meredith:** We're trying to figure out what that spelling is.

**Jorja Fox:** My mom made it up, actually.

**Meredith:** She made it up.

**Jorja Fox:** Yeah. Child of the, you know, late sixties, early seventies, somewhere in there.

**Joy:** That's kind of cute.

**Meredith:** That is very cute.

[...]

**Meredith Viera:** Jorja, what the New York Times thought of it.

**Jorja Fox:** "(laughter)" Um, I was somewhere in there, I think, behind the heart-soap stuff.

**Joy:** Did you buy it, did you feel that, you know...

**Jorja Fox:** I had friends who flew in from New York City yesterday and had a long flight and presented me with the Times, and I heard where I was going to be this morning.

**Joy:** No, but you go by the storyline, on The Bachelorette.

**Jorja Fox:** Oh, on The Bachelorette, I'm sorry I was "(points her thumb at the backstage area, lots of laughter)"

**Joy:** Throw the Times away and think trash.
