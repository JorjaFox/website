Jorja has a raise on her mind. The star of "CSI" staged a one-day walkout from the set during the shoot of the CBS show's season finale, which airs May 17. The actress is in talks with producers about a new contract to keep her on the show, sources familiar with the discussions tell TV Guide. How those talks go may decide the result of the cliff-hanging finale in which Fox's character, Sara Sidle, is struck by an automobile. At one point the story had Sidle dying, but it was rewritten to be more ambiguous and Fox returned to work. Neither the network or a spokesperson for Fox would comment.

Fox had a salary dispute with the show in 2004, when she and costar George Eads demanded raises before they would show up for the start of production. They were both promptly fired and then reached an agreement to return to work. But Fox's character has become more prominent in the series over the last year. Sidle's relationship with Gil Grissom (William Petersen) has given the series its first serious romantic story line.
