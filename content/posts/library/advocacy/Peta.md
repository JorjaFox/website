PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is the largest animal rights organization in the world. 

PETA focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of beavers, birds and other 'pests,' and the abuse of backyard dogs. 

Jorja Fox is a supporter of PETA and has attended many functions, as well as appearing in a celebrity vegetarian testimonial campaign.
