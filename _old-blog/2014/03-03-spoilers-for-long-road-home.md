CSI Files has posted a bevy of spoilers for Long Road Home. You can read<a href="http://www.csifiles.com/content/2014/02/csi-rocks-out-in-long-road-home/"> 'CSI' Rocks Out In "Long Road Home"</a> for all the details, and while there's nothing Sara specific, this was the episode I was on set for.
<blockquote>According to CSI Files sources, “Long Road Home” opens at a rock concert. Marcy Cody is one of the fans in the crowd, and she’s having a great time—at least until she winds up dead later that night. Marcy’s body is found inside a 24-seat limo, surrounded by the remnants of a party. She was stabbed in the chest three times, but the lack of blood in the limo proves she was killed elsewhere.</blockquote>
Some extra tidbits, this involves a rock and roll fantasy camp, and the scene I saw filmed was when Nick and Sara go to the crime scene and meet Michael Des Barres's character, who owns the camp. They spent half the day on one, very short, scene (lots of work man!) and then did the 'processing' of the crime scene.
<blockquote><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10050" alt="Gene Simmons" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/03/GenSimmons.jpg" width="275" height="140" />[Gene] Simmons is only guilty of helping a couple of wannabe rock stars live out their dreams. He performed with three men on stage as part of a ‘fame experience’—he has no idea what happened after the fake show was over.</blockquote>
Sadly I didn't get to meet Gene, but the 'Fame Experience' set is pretty wild and looked totally Vegas.

This will likely be a 3-4 star episode for Sara, depending on how some of the scenes play out. Except the usual CSI twists and turns, and remember that anything can happen in the editing room, so don't be shocked if things change! I can't wait to see what it's like with music and everything behind it.

"Long Road Home" will air March 12th, unless something else changes.
