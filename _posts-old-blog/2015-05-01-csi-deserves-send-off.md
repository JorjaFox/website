Look. We just don't know if this is the end yet. We may not know for 12 more days and it's as agonizing to me as you, but I expect it's worse for Jorja and everyone who are just waiting. And waiting. And waiting.

<a href="http://deadline.com/2015/05/csi-final-season-16-cbs-1201419002/">Deadline.com</a> reports:

<blockquote>It is May, and we have another veteran crime procedural that has created a mega-successful franchise, CBS’ <em>CSI</em>, facing an uncertain fate just as it launched a third spinoff series,<em> CSI: Cyber. </em>I hear CBS is considering different options to give <em>CSI</em> a final chapter next season, including a short run — as short as six episodes — but it is not a sure thing.</blockquote>

This happened five years ago, when Law & Order went off the air after 20 seasons. They were dropped days before NBC's upfronts (CBS's are May 13th, you see why we'll know then).

In the case of <em>CSI</em>, it's a bubble show. The ratings aren't what it was, but <em>CSI: Cyber</em>'s not doing as great as they hoped. It's not renewed yet either. The actors are willing to come back, says the rumors, but pretty much everyone agrees that it deserves a better send off than the season 15 finale, which was a good bye to George, but it left so much else up in the air.

I'm betting most (if not all) of you want to see at least one more season.

So do I. Here's hoping!
