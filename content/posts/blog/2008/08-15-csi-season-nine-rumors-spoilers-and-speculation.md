This is an open post for folks to gossip.  Here's the deal of what we know:

* Jorja Fox will be back for at least 2 episodes.
*Lady Heather comes back.
* The characters from 'Too Tough To Die' return

There's more stuff but this is what affects most Jorja/Sara/GSR fans, so I'm putting this out there as it stands.  Yes, there's a rumor about a promo of Sara in Grissom's office (when I find it, IF it exists, I'll post about it).  Yes, there are promo shots of Grissom at [WPAP](http://billypetersen.com).  But as for all those other rumors about how Sara gets thrown out of the lab, Sara's pregnant, Grissom cheats on her... That's all they are.  Rumors. I'm not going to waste my time debunking them, and instead I say this:

**If I know it's true, I will post.  Otherwise, I say nothing.**

Please don't email asking for 'more information!' because if I'm not telling you, its because I don't know.  I've already had to blacklist one person for harassment about this. I will report on things as they're proven, but I don't waste time on idle spec.  It serves no purpose.
