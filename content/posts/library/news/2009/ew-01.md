So much for Grissom and Sara's happy ending!

Less than a year after walking off into the ~~sunset~~ jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return to "CSI" as Sara for multiple episodes - sans Grissom.

According to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn, Fox will reappear in the Sept. 24 episode when viewers will "discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the "CSI" team in Las Vegas."

I'm guessing a nasty breakup is what brings her back, but maybe that's the pessimist in me talking. What do you think is behind her return? And do you hope it becomes permanent? Sound off in the comments!
