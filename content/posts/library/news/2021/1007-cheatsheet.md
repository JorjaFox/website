CSI: Vegas had a fairytale ending for Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Now they’re back for the revived show. Fox talked about the TV characters being married and how playing that is different from before.

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation starts with Grissom meeting Sara at his lecture. He eventually offers her a job as CSI at the LVPD Crime Lab and she takes it.

Grissom’s feelings for Sara were later revealed in season 6, but his workaholic tendencies still prolonged them falling in love. They eventually do try to have a relationship, but their issues make them break up repeatedly.

The show ended with Grissom and Sara sailing off into the sunset together on his boat. Now they’re back and fans will see them interact in a new way.

**Jorja Fox says playing Gil and Sara as a married couple is ‘fun’**

Gil and Sara ended up together and retired to have a new kind of life at the end of the original show. Now fans will be seeing them as a married couple. Fox talked about this big change, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“It was a storybook ending that I loved, so that’s where we left them,” Fox said. “And when we open up on the first episode of CSI: Vegas, Sarah has been called by an old friend who is in trouble and asked if she can come help out.” The actor then revealed Sara calls Grissom for his help in the end.

“We didn’t get to play the relationship that much on screen,” she said. “And in this rendition, we arrive as a married couple and that’s how we’re playing it, so that’s really fun.”

**How the married couple returns for ‘CSI: Vegas’**

CSI: Vegas has returned with some original characters and new ones. The first episode showed Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) getting attacked. He calls Sara for her help to track down the person who hired his attacker.

Sara leaves San Diego and falls right back into things with a new team while Grissom is overseas. But in the end, they find out Brass is only the beginning. Someone is out to get CSI and is accusing them of planting evidence. The episode ended with CSI finding a storage unit under David Hodges’ (Wallace Langham) name full of CSI equipment and files of their cases.

Sara calls Grissom for help to try to clear Hodges’ name. It looks like the married couple will be working together again this season. Hopefully, fans can learn more about their married life as they solve cases.
