TELEVISION actress Jorja Fox is no stranger to violence: She plays
criminal scene investigator Sara Sidle in the top-rating "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation," aired on cable TV over the AXN channel.

But Fox, who has been exposed to numerous cases of death and
suffering in the action-adventure series is against the ongoing US-led
attack on Iraq.

"I send all my prayers to the people of Iraq, especially to the
women and children," she told a group of Southeast Asian writers in a
recent conference.

"Now is a very tense time in the United States," she said. "Never
have the citizens of America been this divided over an issue since the
Vietnam War in the early seventies. I really hope that the split would
turn out into something positive."

"CSI," which is on its third season, is about a team of forensic
investigators, led by senior forensics officer Gil Grissom (William
Peterson), and the crimes they solve with high-tech gadgets by
assessing pieces of evidence gathered at the crime scene.

Fox, 34, who is based in California, describes "CSI" as "an anti-
violence series that presents people in the worst days of their lives."

"It's a show that has subjects most Americans would not want to talk
about," she said.

Despite the serious nature of the topics tackled in the show, "CSI"
is continuously garnering rave reviews in the US.

Fox attributes the show's success to the sense of security it
conveys to its viewers.

"It makes it look very difficult to get away from some crime," she
explained.

The show's producers hired a team of technical advisers and arranged
for crime laboratories in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to be open for cast
members of "CSI" to use, according to Fox. This, she said, is primarily
to help train the actors for their roles as forensic investigators.

"Reading medical trivia books also helped me understand my role
better," she said. "I have always been fascinated with science."

Fox landed the role of Sara in a "very traditional way."

"I went to the audition, read a part, and then left," she
recalled. "I got a call from one of the show's producers a few days
later asking for a meeting."

After two seasons, Fox has learned to adapt Sara's brazen attitude
and passion for work.

She used to get very queasy whenever Sara is made to stitch pigskin
or examine the contents of the stomach of a dead child.

"She is much smarter and courageous than I am," the actress said of
her CSI character. "But I'm as focused as she is when it comes to my
craft."

Fox started acting at age six, and was involved mostly with
independent theater productions when she was in high school.

She first appeared on NBC's top-rated series "ER" as the lesbian
resident intern Dr. Maggie Doyle. She was also featured as the master
thief Pallas in the futuristic film "Velocity Trap," and Delmar
Youngblood in "Hungry Bachelors Club," a story about love and
friendship.

Fox also played the role of secret service agent Gina Toscano in
Aaron Sorkin's Emmy award-winning drama "The West Wing."

But her role as Sara is one of Fox's prayers that have been
answered.
