From EW <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/17/william-petersen-csi-finale-sara-grissom">CSI finale: William Petersen's lips are sealed on a potential Sara-Grissom reunion</a>:

<blockquote>It’s the end of an era: after 15 years on the air, CSI is coming to a close on Sept. 27 with a two-hour movie finale. The creators, producers, and cast met up on closing night of this year’s PaleyFest Fall TV Preview for a farewell salute panel on Wednesday (moderated by EW’s own Lynette Rice), and we caught up with William Petersen and some of his costars on the red carpet before the event to get their thoughts about the end of CSI.  

[...]

As CSI investigates its last grisly crime on TV and Petersen comes back for one final appearance, fans are wondering how the finale will address Grissom’s romance with Jorja Fox’s character Sara Sidle.

“Well, we do see each other again,” Petersen teases vaguely. “And talk to each other — as best we can, because we’re not very good at that.” But that’s all he would say. “It’s really a secret!”</blockquote>

And from TVLine <a href="http://tvline.com/2015/09/17/csi-series-finale-spoilers-grissom-sidle-relationship/">CSI Finale Preview: Grissom and Sidle's 'Awkward' Reunion, MIA Nick and More</a>:

> <strong>THE EX FACTOR | </strong>Grissom and Sidle will have two hours to work out their romantic woes — and it sounds like they’ll need every precious minute. “We do see each other again, and we talk to each other as best we can,” William Petersen hints, “because we’re not very good at that.”
> 
> Not only does Jorja Fox confirm that the couple’s long-awaited reunion is “awkward, because we kind of broke up,” but Melinda Clarke’s Lady Heather will complicate things in the finale, considering the dominatrix “wreaks havoc everywhere she goes.”

Nine days.
