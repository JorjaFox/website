And we're into week two! Looks like Zuiker had to take down his tweets from last week (possibly was asked to do so?) so thankfully I saved the content. The images didn't have anything super useful.

Since then... it's been very very quiet.

Last week was everyone sitting around the writers' room, talking about the plot. Once they have the breakdown done, the script is next. So far we know that David Rambo will be involved, Anthony Zuiker is writing the script (or at least part of it), and Billy and Marg have signed on to be in the movie. Seeing as Ted Danson's moving to _CSI: Cyber_, it's a good bet he'll be in.

Now that said... that's all we know. It's summer, and Eric Szmanda's off in Pennsylvania performing in The Nerd:

Elisabeth Harnois (who had a birthday the day before me!) has said thank you:

And other than that.... we don't know. As soon as I hear if Jorja etc signs on for the movie, I'll let you know. I think it's okay to assume she'll do it (Billy's involved after all) but please keep in mind we don't have it confirmed.

Who would you like to see show up in the movie? In a way I'm comparing it to the Veronica Mars movie, so I hope for cameos from Brass and Ecklie and Sofia Curtis (Louise Lombard), a shout out to Sara's Mom and Lady Heathe and Warrick, and maybe a mention of Paul Millander.
