TV|Line asked their readers what they wanted to see in 2012.
<blockquote>“The dead can't speak for themselves, so let me speak for them: They (and we, the loyal CSI viewers) desperately want to see at least one guest appearance by William Petersen. No one solves cases like Grissom, plus we need a little clue as to where he's been, right?” –T.J.</blockquote>
