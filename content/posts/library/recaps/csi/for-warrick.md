## Synopsis

After being shot by Undersheriff McKeen, who calls in the crime, Warrick is found by Grissom and dies in his arms. McKeen tries to frame another dirty cop, Pritchard, who killed Gedda and tried to frame Warrick. The CSIs try to solve the crime, and quickly exclude Pritchard from their suspect list and replace him with McKeen due to inconsistencies in McKeen's report. From his phone records and the tiny partial off the bullets in the murder weapon, the CSIs trace McKeen to a hotel where he happens to have Pritchard holed up. It's too late, however, as the men have rabbited to Mexico. On the road, Pritchard shoots McKeen, sending their car through the guard rail. Pritchard dies on impact, but McKeen is caught by Nick, who contemplates shooting him, but does not.

The episode ends as Grissom speaks at Warrick's funeral, with all the lab in attendance.

## Review

Sara arrives a few hours after Warrick has been killed and waits for Grissom in his office; she hugs him, and hugs everyone else when they arrive. Grissom tells Sara how Warrick died, and that he loved him. Unable to work on the case, Sara takes over the funeral arrangements. Sara and Greg go to Warrick's apartment, where they learn he has a son and was suing for custody. When Sara tries to show the paternity suit evidence to Grissom, he tells her 'Not now.', but she insists. While she and Grissom are watching Warrick's paternity suit tape, at one point (on tape) Warrick says that Grissom inspires him -- Sara glances over at Grissom. Ecklie lets Sara sit in on the case review, and she suggests they try and print the .25 caliber shell casing which gives them their first solid evidence on McKeen.

## Notes

* Sara lives near enough to Vegas to get there in a few hours.
* Sara knows how Warrick felt about Grissom.
* Sara used to clean up her place every time before she left it -- in case she never came back. Since leaving Vegas, she's ceased to do that.
