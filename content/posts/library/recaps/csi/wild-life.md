## Synopsis

Brad Malone, after loosing 100 grand at the Eclipse Casino, falls and splatters his brains over the floor. Nick, Ray and Catherine determine he fell from the balcony of the room next to his own. The two women in the room had been 'celebrating' ones recent divorce, and the night had gotten out of hand, with alcohol, a little GHB, and some consensual, if later regretted, sex, which ended with Brad accidentally falling off the balcony mid-coitus.

Meanwhile Lance and Denise Irwin, are found dead in their apartment, with the cat missing but the bird still in it's cage and no money stolen. For years, the Irwins had been mutually abusive, and their behavior translated to their pets. Mr. Irwin was showering, with the bird, when the cat attacked, knocking him into the wall and killing him. The now free bird attacked Mrs. Irwin, who accidentally stabbed herself. The cat ran and hid, while the bird called 911 and then locked itself back in the cage.

## Review

Sara and Greg work the domestic abuse case, which Sara handles far better than she did in the past. S When first presented with the idea that the parrot killed Mrs. Irwin, Sara winds herself up and Dr. Robbins has to talk her down a bit.

## Notes

* Sara remains quick to judge men in abuse cases.
