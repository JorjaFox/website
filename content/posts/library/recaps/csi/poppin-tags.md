## Synopsis

Three members of a rap artist Hi-Def's street team are found dead after attempting to hang posters of rival rapper, Dollar, in a bikini and a 'Dude's Gone Wild' pose. The poster was made off a video taken while Dollar was held at gunpoint, which was orchestrated by one of Dollar's own street team; Dante. Dante had only joined up to get close to Dollar. His sister, Trish, had been in a 'Girls Gone Nuts' video, made by Dollar, and when their father saw it, beat Trish nearly to death.

The video was then sent to Hi-Def's right-hand woman, J-Lady, who possibly let it spread all over the internet. Three kids from Hi-Def's street team went to poster unflattering pictures from the tape over Vegas, and the posters were seen by a member of Dollar's street team. Another member, Morris, worshiped Dollar, and took the gun his older brother had stolen, and gunned down Hi-Def's street team, killing all three members.

The driver of the car confessed to running over one of the kids, and fingered the shooter, Morris. Dante was also in the car at the time of the murders, and confessed to having set Dollar up.

## Review

Sara's time is mostly spent going over the car used for the drive by, and going with Sofia and Nick to talk to Hi-Def.

## Notes

* Sara inspects the car, showing a consistent theme with her and vehicles.
