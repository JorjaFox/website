Once again, I'll update the post later tonight, once I have screencaps etc.  And yes, finally I can watch the episode on time, so you will get a recap and screencaps before midnight tonight.

The usual rules apply, but because there's expected to be a hot and heavy Catherine/Vartann scene, please remember to respect <em>all</em> ships.

<h2>Official Release</h2>
A vampire and werewolf convention is at the heart of a murder investigation in Las Vegas.

Well. Okay.  Two stars again.  Sara spent most of her time in the lab.  So she's replacing Wendy?  Not really sure there.  Wendy was mentioned a couple times, by the way, but basically this was a decent episode.  The one scene of Sara and Nick was absolutely adorable, and worth it.
