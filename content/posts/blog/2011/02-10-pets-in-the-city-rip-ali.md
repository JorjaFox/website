Jorja was recently on [Pets in the City](https://www.petliferadio.com/cityep38.html) and talked about ADI and her dog, Ali.

I knew Ali was sick, so I can't say I was terribly surprised that she passed away. Fourteen is pretty awesome for a boxer, though.  I'll be sending out a card from everyone here at JFO (including you!) today.

This time, the marvelous Ann transcribed the whole interview for you and I'll let her take us in!

The online radio show _Pets In The City_ is a online radio show based out of New York City, and includes news about animals, celebrity sightings, and also has on celebrity guests from time to time. Just recently, their special guest was Jorja, who came on to talk about _CSI:_&nbsp;and also the continued ADI Bolivian Lion Arc project.

It's a phone interview, so the sound isn't the best quality, but you can understand what she's saying. There's also commercials (sorry about that). But, incase you can't listen to the interview or understand it, I've transcribed it for you under the cut!

I have to say, I've heard a lot of interviews with Jorja over the years, but this is probably the best, longest, and most informative of them all. In the interview, Jorja talks about ADI's incredible lion rescue, dishes about Grissom and Sara, talks about her time on _CSI_, tells us more about Sara, admits that she was outsmarted by a 12-year-old twice, celebrates her late dog Ali who just passed away (may she rest in peace), and tells us all how we can get involved in helping to save the lions.

As for the interview itself, Ann graciously allowed me to repost it here: **[Pets In The City Transcript](/library/transcript/2011/pets-in-the-city/)**.

(By the way, it takes about three hours to transcript something of that length. I know I appreciate it when someone else takes the time out of their day to do it for me, so please send love and cookies to Ann!)
