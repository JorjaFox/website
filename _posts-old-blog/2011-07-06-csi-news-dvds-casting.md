First up: DVDs!

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3521" title="CSI_S11_e" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/07/CSI_S11_e-143x200.jpg" alt="" width="143" height="200" /><a href="http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/CSI-Season-11/15615">TV Shows on DVD</a> is happy to tell us that the 6-disc set for Season 11 will be out September 24th.  No blu-ray, folks.  Sorry.  And no Sara on the cover.  As with all the DVDs, someone else will have to buy it to tell you about the extras.  I still have yet to buy any of them.

On the plus side, though, Justin Beiber <em>isn't</em> on the cover either, but he is mentioned in the press release.  I suppose you take what you can get, some days.

Second up, new actors.

TV Guide Magazine has some interesting tidbits.
<blockquote>**CASTING CALL**
The producers of <em>CSI</em> are still hunting for the lab's next investigator, but executive producer <em>Carol Mendelsohn</em> is said to have drawn up a character who is a bit more lighthearted than <em>Laurence Fishburne's Ray Langston</em> [and more in the vein of <em>Gil Grissom]</em>. CBS is expected to find someone with seasoned TV chops.</blockquote>
Interestingly, they start filming on July 18th, so they really should have the person cast already.  But that's up to them.

And no. Still no news on if Jorja's back next season.  At this point, since we know the first episode of the season will wrap up what happens to Langston, I'm fairly sure we'll get closure all around there.
