**What is your idea of perfect happiness?**

An open road, or sea for that matter. I'm a nomad.

**What is your greatest fear?**

That I will have been too reserved.

**Which living person do you most admire?**

Currently Robert David Hall - he plays Dr Robbins on CSI. He's had some very rough breaks and has never let any of them get the best of him.

**What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?**

I'm a yes person. I'm too concerned with trying to make too many people happy.

Gardenias. And rain.

Sleeping in.

I'm sure I haven't had it yet.

My birthday suit.**What has been your biggest disappointment?**

I wanted to be a lead singer in a band. I can't sing. I'm almost tone deaf. I still play. Next life, rock'n'roll for sure.

As often as possible.

**What single thing would improve the quality of your life?**

Equal rights for everyone in America.
