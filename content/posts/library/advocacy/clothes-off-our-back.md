"The Clothes Off Our Back" is a 501 (c) 3 organization that hosts charity auctions and private events showcasing today's hottest celebrity attire. Items are put up for bid to the public with proceeds going to select children's charities each year. Clothes Off Our Back was founded by actors and philanthropists Jane Kaczmarek ('Malcolm In The Middle') and Bradley Whitford ('The West Wing') whose efforts, along with their celebrity friends and auction participants, have helped spread awareness and improve the lives of children across the globe.

In 2003, Jorja Fox donated to raise money for Autism.
