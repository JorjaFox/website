<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-ratings-departures/u-s-actor-fishburne-poses-in-front-of-the-ancient-colosseum-in-rome/" rel="attachment wp-att-3399"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3399" title="U.S. Actor Fishburne poses in front of the Ancient Colosseum in Rome" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2011/06/ENTERTAINMENT-US-FISHBURNE-100x100.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>By now, we all know the surprising truth:  <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/laurence-fishburne-leaves-csi/">Laurence Fishburne will leave <em>CSI</em> next season</a>. The popular quote right now is "Nobody expected him to be on the show for 7 years, it's Laurence Fishburne."  While that may be true, the question most people I know are asking is "Will he show up in any episodes?"  I would bet we'll get him in at least one.  If anything, we should see <em>some</em> closure about the Haskell situation (anyone want to make bets on if he's found guilty?) but they don't necessarily need him to be in the episode for that.  The other question I get is about that <a title="CSI One Sheet" href="https://jorjafox.net/2011/csi-one-sheet/">One Sheet</a>.  Well.  Guess what kiddies?  That wasn't a finalized product!  I've been told all names will be spelled correctly in the final version.

You can see a lot of posts about this on <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=0&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=laurence+fishburne">Google News</a>.

In non-news, <em>CSI</em> will be on Wednesday next season.  Marg is set for 'some' episodes (common consensus is 'half').  The Wednesday competition is <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU</em>, which lost Chris Meloni (the male lead) and will be losing Mariska Hargitay (female lead) after 13 episodes, or so I understand.

Lastly, a lot of people saw Deadline Hollywood's post stating <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/csi-most-watched-series-in-world-again/">CSI is the most watched series on TV.  Again.</a> What that means is worldwide, if you added up viewers everywhere, <em>CSI</em> is still number one.  Why were the ratings so bad?  <em>CSI</em> <del>is</del> was up against a couple younger, more popular shows like <em>Bones</em> (which is on a huge upswing, though the multiple pregnancies are pretty big shark jumpers) and <em>Greys Anatomy</em> (a soap, I watch it, but it's a soap).  It lost a good lead in -- be honest here, did any of you watch <em>$#*! My Dad Says</em> except because it was on between <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> and <em>CSI</em>?  Right.  You see my point.

Next season, season 12, will certainly be a season of change for everyone.  As soon as I know if Jorja will be back, you know I'll let you know!  Until then, speculate away in the comments.
