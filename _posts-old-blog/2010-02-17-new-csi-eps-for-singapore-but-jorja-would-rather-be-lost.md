The article has the sort of tidbits we've come to love from Jorja, like how she'd like to snag the metal cabinets from autopsy when _CSI_ finally ends, or how she's been telling her manager for years she wants to be on _Lost_ as one of the Others, because she loves the science fiction theme of the show.  And if it hadn't been Grissom and Sara, she would have liked it to be Greg and Sara.

<blockquote> 'It amazes me that the show is played in so many parts of the world like Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore.

'So I got to see myself speak in 20 different languages. I couldn't believe it. I can barely speak English,' Fox joked.</blockquote>
