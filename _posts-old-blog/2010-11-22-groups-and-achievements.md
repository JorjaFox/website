<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/11/butterfly-100x100.png" alt="" title="butterfly" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2731" /> After careful consideration over the course of a cup of coffee, I decided to make two changes to the site.

**There's a new group called <a href="https://jorjafox.net/groups/gsr-fans/">GSR Fans</a>**

This group is for people who are PRO GSR.  If you don't like Grissom/Sara, stay the heck out!  In that group, members can post all about their relationship. The only thing I ask you <em>not</em> post is fan fiction.  But treat it like an open forum to just go bonkers about GSR.  And yes, the butterfly image was intentional.

There are some other <a href="https://jorjafox.net/groups/">Groups</a> out there, but if you have an idea for another group we should have, let me know!

**You can now earn Achievements**

Achievements are like those goofy things you win playing Facebook games or video games.  Right now there are two kinds of achievements. Event driven achievements are ones you win for joining groups, or commenting on the site.  Award achievements are ones I hand out for members who do things like send me photos we don't already have, find news, and other totally random things.

What can you do with achievements?  You can turn them in for ... er ... nothing right now. But you get bragging rights!  And if you can think of other achievements that would be cool, speak up!
