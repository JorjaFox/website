So Sara never read comics, and her escape was science and math. If you're shocked, you've not been watching the same show I have. That moment was a great one between Sara and DB. I really like their work relationship.

There's enough of Sara in here, with some backstory, to give this a four star rating for Sara! Her soft heart stung her again and she got to read some comics. No time for fantasy in her youth makes me kind of sad. And that has nothing to do with the collection of Batman comics in my office.

That was our first double header CSI. We have another new episode on <em>Tuesday</em> the 25th, and then the last two episodes of the season on the 15th of February.
