Yes, Jorja is in Dead Air. Alas not in the images that CSI Files got.

First breaking news (US only, sorry, it's just the promo):

Some spoilers for you:
<blockquote>Daniel Roebuck fans will be excited to see him in his guest spot on this episode. According the spoiler photos he is playing the show director when the lights went out and the studio became a crime scene which will make him a suspect. You will also see Greg Sanders (played by Eric Szmanda) get extra attention from Chad Lane during the investigation - making him a suspect as well.</blockquote>
