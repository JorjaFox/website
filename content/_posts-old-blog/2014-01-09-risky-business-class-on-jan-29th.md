I know, they totally janked us over Christmas (maybe they felt guilty?) but the Press Pool is reporting that "Risky Business Class" will re-air on January 29th.

No really! <a href="http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=37778">CBS PressExpress says so</a>!
<blockquote>"Risky Business Class" — When five people are killed in a small plane crash a mile off the Vegas strip, the CSI team is called to investigate.  Also, Sara feels the strain of having a long-distance relationship with Grissom when a former lover of hers is involved with the crash investigation, on a rebroadcast of CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Wednesday, Jan. 29  (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. (Originally broadcast 12/12/12.)
