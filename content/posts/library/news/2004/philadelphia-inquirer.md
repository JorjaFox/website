We have disquieting news for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation fans.

Jorja Fox and George Eads, two of the stars of CBS's hyper-literate police drama, have been fired for breach of contract. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the actors had been in a dispute over their salaries.

We find CBS's move particularly lame, not only because we find Fox to be charming (she's got an exquisitely complex face whose slightest gesture tells a whole story), but also because her character, Sara Sidle, has had some serious chemistry with head CSI dude Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen). We'd been praying for a romance; now our hopes are shattered. A CBS rep had no comment for the Reporter.
