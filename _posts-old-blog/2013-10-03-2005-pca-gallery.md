This was different. This time I upgraded a mess of photos, uploaded new ones, and reordered them. So .. er .. Yeah. Red Carpet images first, then the press room.

Oh and a lot are like a pixel or three different. Someone was snap happy! I like this one because only Paul's looking at this particular camera, and it's almost as if everyone else was having a different conversation.

How to know what images are new? The ones with a star (they vanish after 15 days, so if it's mid October or later, there you go).
