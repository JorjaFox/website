"My six-pack is not like most actresses' &#8212; my six-pack is beer."

**From gritty crime scenes to sexy love scenes, JORJA FOX's role on "CSI" has been through a lot of changes due to her new romance.**

**WITH HER TOMBOYISH** demeanor and love of rock music, surfing, beer and dogs, no one, least of all actress Jorja Fox, would have predicted that she'd be in one of the most talked-about love affairs on TV this season. But as one of the stars of "CSI", Jorja has given the CBS drama a hot new look, with her character, Sara Sidle, going from crime scenes to love scenes. Her surprising romance with fellow forensics investigator Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen) is keeping fans guessing at the snow near the top of the ratings in its Thursday-night battle against ABC's "Grey's Anatomy",

"I'm really exited about the thing between Grissom and Sara," Jorja told "OK!". "What's not sexy about William Petersen? Going into the seventh year of a show, to have something so big and so different to play after all this time is very unique and rare. We're having a ball. I hope the fans love it."

A self-described hippie, Jorja often comes to work with her best friend, her dog Ali. "I'm crazy for animals. I love them!" Jorja said when we caught up with her at the Oct. 5 opening of the North Central Animal Care Center, a remodeled Los Angeles city shelter for dogs, cats and rabbits. Jorja couldn't be happier that the city has created a clean, safe facility where solar panels keep pets warm and a misting system keeps them cool until they can be adopted.

"I've been to the shelter a number of times," she said. "I think it's better than anybody could even imagine it. I would invite everybody who lives in Los Angeles to come down and check it out to see the future of L.A. and the commitment of Angelenos to caring for pets."

Jorja's four-legged pal, Ali, 10, is a shelter dog herself and is named for the famous boxer Muhammad Ali. "She's Ali the boxer, because she's so pretty," Jorja smiled. "I've always had a dog in my life. I know this is a cliched thing to say, but she's my best friend."

Jorja's love for animals affects her diet as well. "I am a 20-year vegetarian," she said. "I eat a lot of grains and vegetables and fruit and soy products. I eat a little bit of dairy, especially if I can find it organic and made in local, humane and free-range conditions."

Still, she does admit to allowing herself "some" splurges. "Chocolate, coffee, pizza. And beer. I could show you my six-pack, which is not like most actresses' six-packs in this town!"

Calling herself a minimalist who doesn't like to collect too many things, Jorja does make an exception for jeans. "I probably have 10 pairs of sneakers and nine pares of jeans. I like the old-school Levi's and Wrangler's that you might get an at army surplus store. I also wear a lot of Seven and True Religion."

Jorja says in shape by running, hiking, camping and kayaking. She also finds herself surfing "just for the fun of it," she said. "I'm kind of goal oriented, and when I'm surfing, I have no goals at all. I just like to enjoy myself."

The 38-year-old star who once played rock music has put it on the back burner to focus on "CSI". "I get together with friends and play music from time to time, in the adult-alternative vein," she said. "I don't have the time to actually be in a band. Someday, when "CSI" is over and done, maybe I'll start a new bad. Mostly I play guitar; most people don't care for my singing. But I love to sing, so I do it a little bit," she smiles.

Jorja's other favorite side project is producing plays. On her next hiatus, she hopes to help her friend, actress Kirsten Holly Smith, continue her one-woman show, "Blue-Eyed Soul: The Life and Times of Music Legend Dusty Springfield", the story of the famed '60s soul singer.

But her focus this fall is on her show, as "CSI" faces a ratings challenge from the sexy doctors of "Grey's Anatomy". "We've been number one for longer than I ever thought it would be possible to hold that title," she said. "it's been an amazing ride. I'd love to stay there. I think that we've all got our game faces on and we're going into the season very humble and very hungry. It's nice to have some competition. But I do hope we win!"
