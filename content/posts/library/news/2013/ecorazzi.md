"'Jorja Fox"' has a new best friend that she wasnt expecting to find.

The actress recently told People magazine that after losing her beloved dog, she didnt feel ready yet to welcome a new dog into her heart when she ended up rescuing a poodle mix named Bexar (the name is pronounced "bear")."When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of 14 years. I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit and she did the same to me," she said.

The two have become buddies, though. Fox added, "Then all of a sudden, it flipped, and now I'm completely in love with her. She's the coolest, little scruffy dog I ever knew"

The star of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"might be a full-time rescuer if not her for her acting job. She said, "If my life had gone in a different direction, this is something I mightve gone into. Animal welfare has given me an anchor in life."

Among other efforts, Fox has also advocated for a vegetarian diet, spoken out against circus cruelty, and been honored for her work helping to rescue 29 circus lions with Bob Barker and Animal Defenders International (ADI). Fox is one of ADIs ambassadors.
