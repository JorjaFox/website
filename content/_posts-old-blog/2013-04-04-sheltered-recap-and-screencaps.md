The case was interesting enough, just enough twists and turns to catch you here and there, but not one of the greatest of CSI episodes (and an anti-climactic ending). I don't have any quotes, but if you do, sound off in the comments and I'll add them.

There's no Sara expected in next week's episode. I'll probably use the time to take better screenshots of the last two episodes.
