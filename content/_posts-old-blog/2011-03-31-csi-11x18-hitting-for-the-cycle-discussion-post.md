Jorja is in this episode! Huzzah!  You'll catch it tonight on an all new <em>CSI</em>!
<h3>Official Release</h3>
A string of deaths, including a gamer found dead on his couch and a newly divorced man at the bottom of a pool, instigate a bet among the CSIs as to whether they've "hit for the cycle" – a homicide, a suicide, an accidental and a natural death all in one night.

<h3>Recap</h3>
<del>Coming Soon</del> So yes, there's that.  It was a cute episode.  Gross, funny, entertaining (a little obvious).  Someone sent Sara flowers.

"Someone from the dayshift sent me flowers."

"Does he know you're married?"
