**Q. ****I guess I missed an episode, because I have no idea why Sara (played by Jorja Fox) is back on "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." The last I saw, she quit and went to live in the jungle, followed shortly by Grissom. Later, she made a statement about her husband being in Paris. Could you please clear up this puzzle?**

**A.** The CBS show wrote Sara out during season eight, and she bowed out by leaving Grissom (William Petersen) a letter explaining that she had to go away to deal with personal demons. She popped back in for the first couple of episodes in season nine, then reappeared very briefly toward the middle of that season when Grissom also left and met up with her in Costa Rica.

Sara then stayed absent until the start of the 10th season, when she returned to the crime lab to help because of short staffing, due in part to the death of Warrick (Gary Dourdan). Sara declared then that she and Grissom are married now, and he's in Paris teaching at the Sorbonne. Evidently in their case, absence does make the heart grow fonder &ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp; and will continue to, since Sara is expected to remain on board for the show's next season.
