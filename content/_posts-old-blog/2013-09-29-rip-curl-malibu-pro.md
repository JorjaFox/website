Alas, this time I only have one, but it's a nice one. Mark Ruffalo and Simon Baker with Jorja:

What I love best is that Mark and Jorja were in "The True Story" together, so I kind of like to see it as a reunion. In 2004, it would be all "Hey, Mark, things working out since I was cut from your show?" But of course now in 2014 it's "Hey, Jorja, still on CSI while I'm playing the Hulk?"
