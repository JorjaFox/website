**Star Jones:** In the mean time my girl is here.

**Jorja Fox:** Hey. (hug)

**Star Jones:** Hey Jorja, nice to see you.

**Jorja Fox:** How are you?

**Star Jones:** So we are looking at one of the stars of one of the number one shows [[CSI]] ...they're still watchin' Jorja.

**Jorja Fox:** Ahh, thank you.

**Star Jones:** You've got to show yourself off here Jorja, because everybody's looking for you.

**Jorja Fox:** I'll try...okay.

**Star Jones:** Okay, got to tell you, great figure...

**Jorja Fox:** Thanks.

**Star Jones:** I'm not going to pick on you and say if you ate a doughnut you'd look pregnant, but what did you eat today girl?

**Jorja Fox:** (laughs) I had a half of a real Food Daily cheeseburger.

**Star Jones:** You did!

**Jorja Fox:** That's all I had, yeah.

**Star Jones:** Yeah, but you did have a little cheesburger. A little nourishment.

**Jorja Fox:** Yeah, vegetarian with the vege bacon and the vege cheese...but it's a cheeseburger.

**Star Jones:** But it's still a cheeseburger.

**Jorja Fox:** Oh yeah.

**Star Jones:** You didn't do that stalk and cellery and lettuce thing?

**Jorja Fox:** No, no, no, I gave up on all that.

**Star Jones:** You did?

**Jorja Fox:** No, I can't maintain all that. And I had a little bit of vodka and 7Up in the car. But don't tell anyone, shh.

**Star Jones:** That's my girl, so you're drinking vodka and 7Up in the car, shh, don't tell anyone... what are you listening to on the radio?

**Jorja Fox:** Radio didn't work, my goodness, so we listened to you know, sky, the sky sounds, that kind of thing. Sometimes I bring CDs, but I bring em', then I forget em'. So I try to leave them at home and I should have today because the radio was broken.

**Star Jones:** So all over limos in Los Angeles have like a stock of Jorja Fox CDs.

**Jorja Fox:** (laughs) Yeah.

**Star Jones:** You won't have any left. Are you excited about tonight?

**Jorja Fox:** I am. I love this award show.

**Star Jones:** It's a lot of fun.

**Jorja Fox:** I'm like a little kid. And it's so nice you know, the movie people and the TV people are together...

**Star Jones:** Absolutely

**Jorja Fox:** And it's kind of a small space... and it feels I know it's weird to say but kind of family, like there's a family feel.

**Star Jones:** You know why? Because it's actors honouring other actors, and you all are a family.

**Jorja Fox:** Yes, exactly.

**Star Jones:** And I just want to tell you...

**Jorja Fox:** A happy family.

**Star Jones:** A little dysfunctional, but a family none the less. Well, we wish you the best for CSI this year.

**Jorja Fox:** Thank you. You are wonderful.

**Star Jones:** Thank you.

**Jorja Fox:** I love seeing you here.

**Star Jones:** Yes, keep watchin' baby, keep watchin', we'll see you next time.
