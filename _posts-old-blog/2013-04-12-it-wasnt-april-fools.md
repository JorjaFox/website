The Guest Author was _not_ an April Fools joke, nor was it a sign of the apocalypse.

So I was gone Monday and Tuesday, and I knew that there was CSI news coming. I lamented to a friend, who said they were willing to step in and post 'like [I] do' on JFO for a couple days. The line was drawn at figuring out screenshots, which was okay by me. Posting youtube videos and articles and making sure there was an image was all I really wanted. We decided on 'Guest Author' since what if someone else fills in later.

That's all it was, and I didn't mean to scare anyone! I honestly **forget** about April Fools until I read all the daffy things online and go "Oh, another year where I forgot to turn JFO into DCO."

Maybe it's time to get some more 'staff' on board here... (I'm a huge control freak, which Guest has been laughing about for some time now, thanks...)

Questions I got about this!

Q: Where were you?
A: It was Passover. We had folks over, and I don't do tech on Jewish holy days.

Q: Who is Guest Author?
A: A friend and coworker. (I offered to make a 'their name' account and was rebuffed. There will be a vicious game of pingpong in our future.)

Q: Were you telling Guest Author what to post?
A: Yes and no. I did say "If there's news about Jorja, post it. If you don't feel okay posting, leave it as a draft and I'll get to it Tuesday night."

Q: Why did Guest call Jorja 'Fox' or 'Jorja Fox'
A: Why _did_ you call her that? "I've never met her."

Q: Will Guest come back?
A: Maybe. The situation doesn't come up very often.

Q: Can I fill in as a Guest one time?
A: I have to think about that. I did mention I was a control freak, right? I'm kind of detail oriented ("Really?" If only you could hear the sarcasm in that voice...) about posts, formatting, and layout. I want the site to look a certain way. If you really want to deal with that, then maybe.
