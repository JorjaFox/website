From TVGuide.com:
<blockquote><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10585" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/04/4053573790.jpg" alt="Paul Guilfoyle" width="300" height="199" />The finale features a present-day crime that has ties to a mob heist from 25 years prior. Treat Williams guest-stars as a criminalist who tries to help the team find the connection between the cases. Meanwhile, viewers will prepare toÂ <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/news/csi-paul-guilfoyle-leaving-1079634.aspx" target="_blank">say goodbye to original cast member Paul Guilfoyle</a>, as Capt. Brass is forced to make a decision about his future after he suffers a personal tragedy.</blockquote>
His ex-wife died in the season opener, killed by their daughter Ellie. Another personal tragedy would imply that Ellie too dies. There goes Mika's theory that Ellie and Natalie (the Miniature-Crime-Scene Killer) were roommates and would be next seasons killers.
