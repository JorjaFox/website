Isn't it nice to have too many things to reasonably make a single post for each one?

Here's a quick roundup of new photos you may have missed and some news!

<h2>TV Guide Magazine - Fall Preview</h2>

We were always in some kind of mind meld when we were working. There was nobody he would rather be in the lab with or on a crime scene with than Sara. She got it. She got him, and he eventually got her.**Fox:** [_Grinning_] The show is going to air at 10pm, so we can be a little edgier than we were last time.<cite>Source: <a href="https://jorjafox.net/library/news/2021/tvguidemagazine-20210930/">TV Guide Magazine</a></cite></blockquote>
