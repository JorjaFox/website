**CSI**

(CBS)

Rating: \* \* *

The finale word: Last year, CSI broke out of its normal pattern for a two-part finale that buried Nick alive. This year's solid finale stuck closer to the show's extremely popular formula - and yet it seemed to send many fans into a frenzy.

The fuss was not over the fate of a critically wounded Capt. Brass, perhaps because no one really thought his fate was in doubt. What stirred fans was the last scene, which implied that a berobed Gil and Sara had just been physically intimate. Some viewers don't like the idea of the show becoming soapy, and some just don't like Sara.
It makes sense to me that two lonely, damaged and sort of strange people might reach out to each other, so I thought the scene worked. But if you didn't, remember this: CSI is an incredibly well-run series and the moment the producers think the relationship is hurting the show, they'll dump it. So calm down.
