None of us wanted her to go, least of all Gil Grissom ... so it's great news that Jorja Fox, aka CSI Sara Sidle, will return to reprise her role in season nine. Fox is expected to appear in the first three episodes of the year as the team lay Warrick Brown to rest.

Don't bank on any resolution to the truncated love-story between Grissom and Sara, though. As Fox recently told "TV Guide", talking about their feelings isn't something the pair find easy: "As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous. In areas of communicating their hearts, it's never been a specialty for either of them."

Let's hope this time she doesn't say goodbye in a letter!
