Tiffany Paige of Green With Tiffany talks to actress Jorja Fox of "CSI" at the Environmental Media Awards. Jorja was there to represent "Artists &amp; Athletes Alliance". She is on the advisory board of this not-for-profit organization that operates at the nexus between the entertainment community and Washington, D.C.

Her green tip is to take "Meatless Mondays" into 3 more days a week. "One of single-handed biggest things that someone can do to help the environment is to eat vegetarian." Not necessarily all the time, but more. Raising cattle and animals for food uses so much water, and land that gets clear cut, as well as the CO2 emissions from the cows, and the food then needed to feed the animals.
Jorja has been a vegetarian for 22 years.
