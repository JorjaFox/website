Thanks to fan <a href="https://twitter.com/tvcrazyeb/status/494312461646835712">Elizabeth Beaulieu for the tip</a>!

This should get posted on their website eventually, but here's a copy of what it says:
<blockquote>**<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11088" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/07/EW1.jpg" alt="Jorja Fox" width="360" height="480" />Jorja Fox** of <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> makes waves with her stylish selections

And of course remember that CSI airs Sunday, beginning "October 30". Except they're wrong and it starts September 28th. I guess they want you to miss the first four episodes? Who knows. The photo is from a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/model/2007-ew/">2007 shoot for EW</a>.
