**Three Weeks to Daytona** will be out on DVD in Februrary, and you can pre-order from Amazon _right now_.

That's right, you can have Jorja in your living room!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/3-Weeks-Daytona-Scott-Cohen/dp/B00A4Y628Q/ref=lh_ni_t">Pre-order from Amazon now</a> and help make this a happy-happy and a merry-merry for whatever holiday it is that you celevrate.

If you order now, you'll get it in Februrary, and all orders of $25 or more get free shipping from Amazon. Cost is $13 for the DVD, and yes, I pre-ordered before I told you guys.

What? I want to make sure I get mine!
