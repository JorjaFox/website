**Jorja Fox** can't seem stay away from "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation".

The actress - who played a Las Vegas forensic scientist named Sara Sidle - will be a part of the upcoming season premiere and additional episodes of the long-running CBS drama, the network said Friday.

Fox, who was a series regular since the show's first season in 2000, officially left during its eighth season. (Although she was briefly seen last season, the Nov. 15, 2007, episode titled "Goodbye and Good Luck" marked her character's last regular appearance.)

Still, this isn't the first time the star has left and come back to the show.

In March 2004, she and "CSI" costar **George Eads** were fired after failing to submit a letter to CBS confirming they would be on time for shooting. After more than a week of contract disputes, they were rehired without salary raises. Again, in 2007, Fox reportedly did not show to film the seventh season finale - which included a cliffhanger involving her character - due to ongoing employment issues.

According to the Associated Press, the show's executive producer said viewers will find out where life has taken the character and what brings her back.

The show returns Sept. 24.
