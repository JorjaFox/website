Lion Ark has been nominated for Outstanding International Motion Picture in the 45th NAACP Image Awards.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9755" alt="More action adventure than traditional documentary, Lion Ark follows the world's most ambitious and daring animal rescue, with a narrative meticulously compiled from film, interviews, conversations and the reactions of participants as events actually unfold." src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-21-at-12.46.09-PM.png" width="696" height="201" />

See more at the NAACP 45th Image Awards website.

This is probably one award show Jorja will be making time to attend. It will air February 22nd on <a href="http://tvone.tv/">TV One</a>.
