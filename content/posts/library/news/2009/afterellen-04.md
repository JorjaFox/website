**Question:** **There have been rumors that William Petersen will be appearing in the 200th episode of* CSI *directed by his friend William Friedkin. Will [former *CSI *star] Jorja Fox also be appearing with him?**

***-- Carol L.***

**Question:** **Has Jorja Fox ever said anything about her sexuality?**

***-- Sandra, Paris, France***

**Answer**: While the 200th episode of the CBS crime-procedural will indeed be directed by Oscar-winner **William Friedkin** (*The Exorcist*, *The French Connection*), and executive director Carol Mendelsohn [www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00021168.html has said] that Petersen will make a cameo ("Grissom will come back in an organic way, to visit or be on a case with the people that are his family."), there's no official word that Fox will be included in the episode. The only stunt-casting I've heard about so far will include teen country singer **Taylor Swift**, who, according to the show's executive producer, plays "a troubled teenager, the daughter of a couple who run a very seedy Vegas hotel."

If that's not enticing enough to make you watch the show (though I personally think the mere presence of **Marg Helgenberger** should be reason enough), the episode will be set in "the exotic world of Mexican wrestling."

As to Fox's sexual orientation, while there is much speculation about her possible lesbianism on \[jorjafoxisgay.blogspot.com/ the web\] (including on the [www.afterellen.com/node/1605 AfterEllen.com forum]) the actress has never made a statement about it one way or another.
