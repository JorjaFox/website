Back in 2009 there was a celebration for A Night for the Whales, about the premiere of the second season of the Animal Planet  TV series "Whale Wars," and a benefit to raise funds for a new  ship for the Sea Shepherd Foundation.

We knew Jorja went.  I was never able to find photos of her there.

Bones and CSI fans, you can squee now:
