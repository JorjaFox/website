The goat was explained in a way only CSI can do, and Jorja yet again made me forget I was supposed to be screencapping CSI. I had to go back a couple times. Did it feel very anvil-icious to anyone else? The talk with Sara and Mary at the end, about love and being alone, and being fearless, was a little surprising. Not where I expected it to do. Still it was nice to see Sara, the champion of women again. And the scene with Hodges, well, clearly he's forgiven her about the divorce. Maybe his troubling relationship with Elisabetta is why he understands how complicated it can be. Also he tried to make her smile. I forgive him everything for that.
