<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6157" alt="2013 Renewal Scorecard" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2013/01/blog_aa_11-6-121-250x240.jpeg" width="275" height="140" />Once you hit the midway point in the season, most TV blogs start talking about next year. TV Line's scorecard is usually pretty good, and they have CSI listed as <a href="http://tvline.com/2013/01/04/tv-shows-renewed-cancelled-2013-abc-nbc-cbs-fox-cw/2/">A Sure Thing.</a>

You can check out their list atÂ <a href="http://tvline.com/2013/01/04/tv-shows-renewed-cancelled-2013-abc-nbc-cbs-fox-cw/">2013 Renewal Scorecard: What's Coming Back? What's Getting Cancelled? What's on the Bubble?</a>

I find it interesting that SVU is an 'either way' sort of, since that's really the main Drama competition for CSI these days on Wednesday.
