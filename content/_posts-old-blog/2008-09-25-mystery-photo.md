Some fans have reported getting a <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/pro/autographs/auto-2008.jpg">mysterious new headshot</a> of Jorja, signed, usually with their name, in a strangely cropped sort of shot.  I was asked why I didn't mention this earlier.  Well apparently my letter was sent to my old residence, and took most of a month to find me.

So. Yes it is from Jorja.  Based on the addressing, I suspect it's a thank you from the scrapbook, because when I sent her the birthday stuff, I was using my new address already. Either way, it's pretty much Jorja's way of sending out a personal thank you to us.  So from JFO, Jorja, huge love. It's not everyone who can say the subject of their fan site does this not just for the site runners, but everyone.
