After four seasons as a recurring guest star, Jorja Fox is returning to *CSI* this fall as a full-fledged series regular, sources confirm to TVLine exclusively.

The actress - who was a *CSI* regular for the show's first seven seasons - left the procedural at the start of Season 8 after appearing in only a handful of episodes. She returned for Season 9, but opted to remain a guest star - until now.

The news comes as *CSI* is undergoing a major cast shakeup as it enters its 12th season. As previously reported, Ted Danson has replaced Laurence Fishburne as the new supervisor.

*CSI* launches its new season on Sept. 21, in a new time slot - Wednesdays at 10/9c.
