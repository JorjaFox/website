## Synopsis

DB Russell, his wife, Ecklie, Hodges, Hodges mother, and Morgan all go to the fundraiser for the Sheriff's reelection campaign. While they're there, a triple homicide occurs down the road. One of the victims is the wife of Jack Gilmore, who just so happens to be running the event for the sheriff. The wife was beaten so badly, her internal organs liquified.

Finn and Nick suspect the husband, and when they find bloody a warmup suit and hockey shaft with the logo of Jack's team, they're sure it's him. They track down the team's equipment manager to a former enforcer for Lou Gedda: the man who got Warrick killed. The enforcer rolls over onto Jack, with a recording that Jack tried to hire him to kill someone. Just as all the evidence points to Jack, Finn realizes he couldn't have done it. The brutal attack on the wife took more upper body strength than Jack has, because he's suffering from ALS. Jack was framed.

Donny Price, a mid level drug distributor, was also killed, and was likely the real target. Price was selling drugs to Jack's wife, who was a police informant. And the bullet used was from former Sheriff Jeffery McKeen's gun. The gun used to kill Warrick. Worse, the lead in the Vice team working the Price case was once McKeen's partner.

The CSIs track down the man who helped McKeen outside of prison and, when he refuses to surrender, is shot and killed. Only after he's dead do they learn the man was McKeen's son. The CSIs have no idea how many corrupt cops are in on the problem, so the sheriff instigates a review to weed out the crooks.

On the way home from a dinner later that night, Ecklie and his daughter Morgan are walking home and having a heart to heart. They're just making amends when Ecklie is shot.

Meanwhile, Finn and her new boyfriend, from Vice, are out for drinks when he leaves in a huff. His partner comes up to hit on Finn, but she suspects otherwise. She's right, as they're spying on her to keep her under control.

Russell and his family are home, enjoying an evening twitch grandchildren.

Nick decides Catherine was right and that he's out of CSI.

When Ecklie's shot, Sara calls DB, but DB's granddaughter has already been kidnapped.
