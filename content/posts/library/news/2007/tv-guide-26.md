While the cast gushed about the exhibit, they remained tight-lipped about the fate of Sara (Jorja Fox), whose life hung in the balance at the end of the May 17 season finale. "We ended this season with Sara under a car and that's how we'll start Season 8," says executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. One promising sign: Fox, who's been in contract negotiations with the show, was in attendance last night. Still, she played it coy about her future in the Vegas crime lab. "This is the only time we've left it open-ended," she says. "If I did know, I'd smile and tell you I didn't. But I hope Sara's alive and well and back for a sexy Season 8 romance." And her costars feel the same. "If we find ourselves in the situation that she's not with us next year, we'll be in trouble," says Eads. "There's only one Jorja Fox."
