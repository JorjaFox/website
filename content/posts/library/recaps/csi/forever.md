## Synopsis

A murder aboard a luxurious 747 and the discovery of two formally attired teens in the desert confound Grissom and his crew in this absorbing episode. First, a horse trainer is found dead in the cargo bay of a private jet carrying 12 well-heeled passengers and a million-dollar show horse. Initially, it appears the victim was trampled to death, but Grissom and Catherine uncover evidence of foul play.

Meanwhile, in the Hell's Gate section of Death Valley, Sara and Warrick probe the apparent suicide of a 15-year-old boy found under a bedspread. The investigation intensifies when a girl's body turns up a half-mile away, and the CSIs suspect a ceremonial death.

## Review

Sara and Warrick work the case of the suicides in Death Valley, eventually finding a baby being cared for by the dead girl's mother.

## Notes

* Sara knows the character of Madame DeFarge from Charles Dickens' [A Tale of Two Cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities).
* There is no reaction from Sara about the foster home situation, despite her own history
* Sara is not pleased that the baby will end up back with the grandmother.

## Quotes

**Robbins** Treated himself to a hamburger with pickles and ketchup, chocolate shake, and what I can only assume was super-size fries.\
**Sara:** So that's what killed him.

**Sara:** Vanity, thy name is teenage girl.

**Sara:** I think our girl was a young Madame DeFarge. She made her own death shroud, but she didn't know her own measurements.
