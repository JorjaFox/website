45 pages, double sided, one DVD (I merged all the video and audio into one DVD for ease of shipping) and one heavy box.  Mailing trip will be tomorrow by registered mail.  The count of letters got to 97ish before I lost track.  Some were two lines, some were four pages.  It was all beautiful and I suspect Jorja will love this.
