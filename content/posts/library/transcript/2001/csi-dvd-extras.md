**Jorja Fox** Ah, my character's name is Sara Sidle, and she's come in from San Francisco, ah, the character of Grissom has called her up and said there's, you know, there's a major problem happening down in Vegas, would you come down and help out for a while. So that's what I've done, I've sort of just come off an airplane and like everybody else I haven't slept in like two days, came right in. So that idea is that, ah, I'll just sort of see if I can help out getting to the bottom of this disaster and then go on home to San Francisco.

[...]

**Jorja Fox** I'm a CSI 2 and I'm a forensic scientist who also does some investigative work. So I think that science is my specialty, but I'll be doing a lot of investigating.

[...]

**Jorja Fox** A lot of people attracted to the show will be puzzle solvers and will be very interested in getting to the, the truth of the matter and getting to the depth of the matter, so...

[...]

**Jorja Fox** I can only say that my biggest concern about being so excited to do the show was the day to day of being in the gore and how I deal with that, you know, like 'would that be fun' or would that be like I wasn't quite sure and... I think it's going to be... okay, you know, I still know like if there's something particularly disturbing I probably will skip lunch until we shoot it, finish it.

[...]

**Jorja Fox** I have so much respect and admiration, actually, for the folks who do this, you know, who can, who can show up every day and kind of try and figure out what has happened.

[...]

**Jorja Fox** Sara Sidle is not squeamish. I think she's, you know, she's very cerebral, and she really, she lives for what she does, and I think, uh, she, she can become emotionally affected by what she's experiencing, but it doesn't get in the way of her ability to, to be there and be present in it.

[...]

**Jorja Fox** The intent is not to be gratuitous, you know, but at the same time, ah, because the show is so visual, and, and we can go places with that. There's moments like, you know, we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology, you know, so you want to have that opportunity if you can.
