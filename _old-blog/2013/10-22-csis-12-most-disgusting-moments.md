Don't read this any further if you're eating (or have a sensitive stomach).

From BuzzFeed, here are <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/as-csi-heads-toward-its-300th-episode-watch-its-12-most-disg">CSI's 12 Most Disgusting Moments!</a>

And the bonus comments from Carol?
<blockquote>“Let the Seller Beware,” Season 3, Episode 3

**The crime: **A cheerleader appears to have been eaten. I repeat: A CHEERLEADER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN EATEN. (See No. 12 in the video.) Since the victim had E. coli, her eaters would have taken ill… which is how the CSIs find her killers.
**What’s Sara (Jorja Fox) doing?:** Going through vomit that’s been confiscated as evidence! That’s skin!
**Mendelson: **“Our CSIs always told us that they do collect body fluids; they do collect vomit from scenes. Tell a _CSI_ writer something, and we never forget. We sometimes free associate and put a number of things in one episode. It was a very out-there episode, and we got a _number_ of notes from broadcast.”</blockquote>
She neglects to mention that the meal Jorja and Eric ate right before that scene? Pizza. Jorja was off her feed for a while.

I'm surprised Mr. Liquified didn't make this list (which was semi-provided by the CSI writers).
