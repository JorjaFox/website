This post will be closed later tonight when the screencaps and recap are posted. Don't worry, I'll update this one to make sure you know!  Feel free to post your spoilers, spec, wild theory and hopes and dreams here.

Also cookies to the first person who figures out what name is on Sara's vest!

**Official Release**
When a porn producer and drug dealer are found dead in a relatively upscale Vegas area, the CSIs focus their investigation on members of the neighborhood.

**Spoilers We Know**
Not much! This is the episode that Dustin Lee Abrams was tweeting pictures from, so expect to see more of Sara in the red shirt. Or salmon. Or pink. Whatever.
