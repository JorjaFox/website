Every year around the end of CSI, I spin up a fundraiser in Jorja's name. I like to pick charities that Jorja supports or advocates for, and sometimes I put it up for a vote. And sometimes I don't.

This year I picked "Heal The Bay"

She liked Heal The Bay on Facebook, so I thought we should too!

<a href="http://www.healthebay.org/">Heal the Bay</a> is a non-profit organization that wants to clean up Santa Monica Bay. I've been there, more than once, as I grew up in the San Diego area and spent a lot of my time at the beach. I don't surf, though, only boogie board. But the ocean and the beach have good, strong, memories for me. And finding out that the city of LA, notable for chaining a river in cement, was dumping their untreated sewage into the water horrifies me.

We can't live without water, and the ocean's ecosystem is tied in closely with our continued existence.
