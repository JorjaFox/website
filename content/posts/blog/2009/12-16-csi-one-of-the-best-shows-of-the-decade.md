<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/tvguide-bestshow.jpg"><img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2009/12/tvguide-bestshow-100x100.jpg" alt="tvguide-bestshow" title="tvguide-bestshow" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2154" /></a> Think back to your life 10 years ago.  It was 1999 and we were all wondering if the world would end on December 31st, or at least if our financial systems were going to melt down.  Some of you were just starting high school or college, and now you have jobs. Careers.  Some of you were just getting married, and some had just had their first baby.

Ten years ago, if anyone had told you that you'd be visiting a site for Jorja Fox, best known as a part-timer on _ER_ and _The West Wing_ you might have chuckled and gone back to watching _Seinfeld_ and _The Single Guy_.  The hottest procedural on TV was _Law & Order_, who'd just spun off _Law & Order: SVU_ and then CBS had this silly idea that people wanted to see criminalists!

That was our world when _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ rolled up to our scene, William Petersen popped off a pithy one-liner, Marg Helgenberger sold us on bling-bling, and Jorja Fox gave us a _Three's Company_ joke.

TV Guide confirms what we always thought, that _CSI_ is one of the best shows of this decade.  It certainly changed TV.

<blockquote>Network procedurals are nothing new, but _CSI_'s intense focus on science was. High-tech gadgets, lots of jargon, and the occasional maggot infestation helped the lab nerds look cooler than the beat cops. The original spawned two successful spin-offs to become the _Law & Order_ of the 21st century. </blockquote>
