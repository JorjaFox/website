While the transcript (and videos) aren't up yet, CNN is no slouch on posting the news.

**Lions rescued in Bolivia have new home on plains of Colorado**

<blockquote>The ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker.
Barker and actress Jorja Fox of "CSI" described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN's "Jane Velez-Mitchell.

"It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly," Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses.

Of the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions.

The sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN.
They'll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa.

Living in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April.

"It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter," said Fox.</blockquote>
