Still, T Kyle King manned up and asked <strong>Who’s your favorite Fox?</strong>

You knew our girl made the list, right?  Go visit <a href="http://www.dawgsports.com/2011/1/18/1942206/georgia-bulldogs-basketball-fans-is-mark-fox-your-favorite-fox">Dawg Sports.com</a> and vote for your favorite Fox!  I voted for Jorja. Of course.

<blockquote>Jorja: She was a doctor on "ER," a Secret Service agent on "The West Wing," and a forensic scientist on the original "CSI." Also, her first name (phonetically, at least) is the same as the name of the Peach State, which is a plus, as long as she doesn’t appear in Sanford Stadium at halftime and lead a confusing rendition of the "spell ‘Georgia’" cheer.</blockquote>
