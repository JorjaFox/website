**Jorja Fox to sidle off**

TVGuide.com's Michael Ausiello reports that even though the "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" character Sara Sidle survived her run-in with the Miniature Killer in Thursday night's gripping season premiere, her time on the show has nonetheless come to an end.

Multiple sources confirm that Jorja Fox - whose contract expired at the end of last season - will depart the hit procedural in November, after failing to come to terms on a new long-term deal. Although Fox doesn't outright confirm her exit, in an interview with Ausiello the actress talked about her residual "hurt" feelings following her firing in 2004 for not showing up on the set during contract negotiations.
