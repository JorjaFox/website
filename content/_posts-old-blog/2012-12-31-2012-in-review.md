<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6145" alt="wp-2012" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2012/12/wp-2012.png" width="763" height="271" />I've been using Jetpack (from WordPress) to keep track of stats on JFO for the last couple years. I also use Google Analytics, and I have some server side metrics that I also watch. The reason for all this is it actually tells me important things, like how to make the site faster (and where I need to do that), but also so I can see how certain things (like the recent facelift) turned out. One person emailed me saying she was getting lines cut off on the right, and I hope I fixed that (if not, try emptying your browser cache, and still if not, I need to know your browser version and operating system).

Jetpack is adorable, though and sends me an email at the end of the year to tell me how things are going on JFO. I thought you'd be interested to see the results:

About 55,000 tourists visit Liechtenstein every year. This blog was viewed about **410,000** times in 2012. If it were Liechtenstein, it would take about 7 years for that many people to see it. Your blog had more visits than a small country in Europe!

In 2012, there were **239** new posts, growing the total archive of this blog to 1,420 posts.

The busiest day of the year was January 26th with **2,646** views. The most popular post that day was <a id="busiest-post" href="https://jorjafox.net/2012/willows-in-the-wind-recap-and-screencaps">CSI 12x12 "Willows in the Wind" Recap and Screencaps</a>.</blockquote>
Before anyone gets worried that Catherine's more popular, here are some other stats: The next busiest day for the year was December 13th, with 2,592 views. That was when Risky Business Class aired. A 54-person difference, given how little CBS promoted that episode, should tell you what you wanted to know. Any episode with a lot of Jorja makes this site popular. October was the most trafficked month (January was 4th and December looks like it's a close 5th with a few hours left to go, I expect it to overtake in the next hour).

The most popular individual posts in order are:

This is the first year I haven't seen 'pregnant' on that list. I'm relieved. Out of 149 countries, most visitors came from The United States. The United Kingdom &amp; Brazil weren't far behind. I want to wave at the 1 person from Madagascar, and 2 from Mongolia! Hi! Speaking of you guys....

So that's 2012 in a nutshell. We've had less traffic than last year, about 12%, which isn't unexpected. We're on an upswing right now, so clearly CSI needs to get working on having more Sara centric episodes! Oh, wait, we get another one this year. Yay!
