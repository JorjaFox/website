Which just _happens_ to be where Grissom is teaching.  What does this mean?  Let's break it down:

On Monday, <a href="http://twitter.com/Schumette">Schumette</a> heard from friends that _CSI_ might be filming at the Sorbonne <sup><a href="http://twitter.com/Schumette/status/6203030200">tweet</a></sup> and told <a href="http://www.billypetersen.com">the WPAP</a>, with the caveat that there were no trucks with CBS or _CSI_ written on them <sup><a href="http://twitter.com/Schumette/status/6204608731">tweet</a></sup>.  There was filming at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ykzmmav">5 Place Paul Painlev√©</a>, but by Tuesday it was gone <sup><a href="http://twitter.com/Schumette/statuses/6229814077">tweet</a></sup>.

In the meantime, <a href="http://twitter.com/joylthomas/">joylthomas</a>, who happens to be in Paris right now, was able to confirm via hotel concierge that _CSI_ is filming <sup>tweet</sup>, and she's promised to try and find it.

If you're in Paris and can afford to poke around, please give a shout.  This could be nothing related to _CSI_ or it could be exactly what you're all thinking.  More news as I find it!
