<p>Jorja and Paula spoke with E! about coming back to <em>CSI</em> and what it means to both of them.</p>

<p>While the subject mentions a 'creepy' storyline, really it doesn't. When Jorja was asked about  the storylines, she explained how there are two plots: The over arching one we know about (the lab's under suspicion) and the weekly plots:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There’s two really cool through lines that you’ll see in the whole season. One is a case that we will try and solve throughout the journey of the show, and then the other, the other through line here is every week we’re going to have a really amazing, cool, dark sometimes creepy story line that would generally resolve within that sort of 44 minutes that we have to tell the story. </p><cite>Jorja Fox</cite></blockquote>
