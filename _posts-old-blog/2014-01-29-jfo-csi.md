Yes, I was on the CSI set. No, I'm not in the episode. It was my second time meeting Jorja (the first was <a title="Jorja invited JFO to Spotlight Humane: Chicago" href="https://jorjafox.net/2010/jorja-invited-jfo-to-spotlight-humane-chicago/">the Humane Society event in Chicago, 2010</a>).

<h2>What's the story here?</h2>
Jorja and I were laughing in that photo because my wife had said we'd better move so no one thinks we're faking it.

The backstory? I was invited by Jorja to come to the set and see some filming, which I jumped on because I've always wanted to see a TV show filming. It took a few months to sort things out, since she wanted to make sure I could see a day where she was filming good scenes, but also when it would be okay for me to hang out. I've known this was probably going to happen since mid-October (yeah), but only got the day last Monday, and the time yesterday!

Funny story! Jorja asked CBS about going to the Grammys in October and didn't hear back. Then the Thursday before, they said she could go and gave her tickets. When she told us that, my wife said "That's not enough time to get a dress!" which made us all laugh, and I said, "Well, maybe for _Eric_ to get dressed..." Jorja explained she'd promised to bring Eric, joking that he might be the only person who also wanted to go, but he had an early set call (8am) on Monday, so she had to promise they'd be home by midnight.

You probably want to know about the set. It's _small_! I didn't think it would be that small, but it totally was. Jorja had a scene with George Eads (whom we met, he's a hugger) and the guest Michael Des Barre (who was also in Hungry Bachelor's Club aka Food For The Heart). He and Jorja were old friends from that, and bumped into each other when they both went to see Elvira back in October. Michael is also very friendly and was funny and goofy. George was the only other regular we saw, except for Elisabeth Shue who was leaving for the day as we got there, and he is absolutely hilarious. He's a goofy fun guy, and I quite like him.

We also met a lot of the crew, including Frank Waldeck, Phil, Louis , and a lot of others. Jorja said she memorized everyone's names because she'd feel bad otherwise, so she knew everyone and gave me more names than my poor brain could handle. I found the whole absolutely fascinated, and we (my wife came) spent three hours watching the same scene being filmed from different angles.

Jorja was Awesome, as always. She was working so its not like we were hanging out all pals or anything.

Actually ... we did. And I realize this sounds like I'm bragging or making things up but we hung out in her trailer with her assistant for about 20 minutes before filming started and caught up. She wanted to know about my new job (and I told her it was because of her and this site that I have it), I asked about the Grammys, and we dished a little. Then we went to the set so she could get her vest on and her mic, which was when we met George. In between takes, she'd come over and introduce us to people, made sure we weren't bored, and all that.

After a couple hours of filming, they 'flipped' the set, which means they moved all the cameras to the other side so they could film from the other angle. While they did that, she spirited us away to see the rest of the set, from Grissom's office-- I mean DB's office to Brass's and everyone in between. Jorja's favorite set? Autopsy. Apparently a lot of her friends want to play a background dead body. I said if they needed some innocent bystander to sit and drink coffee while they run by solving crimes, I'm her girl. This was when she was driving us around in a golf cart. The teal shoulder on the right is her assistant. In the mirror you can see my hair and my wife's hat.

After the tour, which is really fast (and no, I didn't take pictures of everything) we went back to her trailer and hung out for another half hour or so. George came by and we chatted about life and just ... stuff. The internet and the crazy impersonators came up, but I also told her I was running a <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/jorjafox46/">Lion Ark fundraiser for her birthday</a>, and she was delighted. So go donate!
<h2>Gimmie spoilers!</h2>
Nope, sorry.

I'm not trying to be mean, or keep things to myself. I promised _not_ to spoil the episode, so I wouldn't talk about what I saw until after the episode airs. But I can tell you some things...

Originally we were supposed to be on set for "<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Killer_Moves">Killer Moves</a>," which is a chess themed episode and very Greg heavy. Due to filming schedules, it ended up being episode 17, "<a href="https://jorjafox.net/wiki/Dear_Mr._Fantasy">Dear Mr. Fantasy</a>" instead. That is, by the way, how I knew Jorja would be in that episode. She's not in 18, by the way. The episode had to be renamed and it's now "Long Road Home" which actually makes as much sense when related to the plot.

Gene Simmons is in it (which was public knowledge anyway). He's playing himself so he's not the killer, sorry. We saw the scene at the Fame Experience with Michael Des Barres and it's from the first act of the episode so it's all setup work for what comes later. Jorja is very consistent from take to take, dialing in Sara very fast. When she teases Nick (there's a mullet joke I hope doesn't get cut!) it's funny and I giggled the first time.

I did not take photos on the set. I could have taken photos of the sound stages for the standard CSI scenes, but I didn't want to. The memory of walking around is more than enough for me, though I hope I'll get to go back and meet some of the other actors!

That was the scene they started right after we left. Alas, we could not stay all day. I really had a fantastic time, and I'd go again in a heartbeat.

Oh and here's my swag!

<a href="https://jorjafox.net/2014/jfo-csi/img_0005/" rel="attachment wp-att-9830"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9830" src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2014/01/IMG_0005.jpg" alt="My gift swag" width="600" height="450" /></a>A copy of "Rescue Tails," two CSI 300'd episode hats, and a CSI crew jersey. Jorja worried they'd be dust collectors, as I mentioned I wasn't a big collector of things (I don't even have the CSI DVDs), but I've already started wearing the hats and plan to wear the jersey. The book is on our shelf. Oh and there's a copy of the script there too. That was a last second grab from Jorja.

So there you have it! I'll answer any questions I can.
