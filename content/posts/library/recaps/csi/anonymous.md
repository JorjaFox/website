## Synopsis

When a man is found dead in a setting disturbingly similar to a previous case (in the Pilot episode), Grissom realizes that a serial killer is on the loose. The Killer begins leaving clues to taunt Grissom, while Sara and Catherine work with Grissom. Warrick and Nick clash when they investigate a peculiar car accident.

## Notes

* While Sara loves the hotel bathroom here, in later episodes she displays a phobia of germs in public places.
