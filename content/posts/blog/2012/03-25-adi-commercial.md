CSI star Jorja Fox is featured in ADI's new video and discusses the heartbreaking capture and training of wild elephants for a life in the traveling circus. Watch this 2 minute video to hear Jorja tell the story of an elephant named Chrissie and learn what you can do to help.

It's important to note that even when a circus isn't abusing an elephant, and some don't, they're still taking them out of their natural habitat and isolating them from their own kind. What if you were away from every other human, save maybe one or two, and tasked to perform tricks? Sounds pretty horrible doesn't it? You have no idea where you are, where you're going, or when it will all end.

I’d like to tell you about Krissy the elephant.

In 1984, Krissy was just two years old, a baby still hugging close to her mother’s side, nestled safe in her extended elephant family and roaming free across miles of African bush.

(“This is a bullhook. It’s heavy, it’s sharp, and it hurts. This is the weapon of choice to get elephants to perform tricks to amuse people.”)

We will never know exactly what happened, but baby Krissy was snatched from the wild, wrenched away from her family and home and brought to America. She was passed from one owner to another until she found herself in a traveling circus in the U.S…

Watch our video about Krissy and please pass it on to a friend to watch.

I am proud to have worked with Animal Defenders International for several years, witnessing their incredible rescues first hand – like Operation Lion Ark when they closed down every circus in Bolivia and airlifted 25 rescued lions to safety in Colorado. I’ve also taken part in their amazing initiatives such as the launch of H.R. 3359, The Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act, in Congress.

ADI really needs your help… to save animals, educate and change the world… together we can end the suffering of animals like Krissy. Please send a donation today.
