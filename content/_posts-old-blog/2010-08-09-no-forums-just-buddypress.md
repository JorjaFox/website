While this information is all linked to under 'Site Help' on the grey bar at the top of every JFO page (it's the links in green), sometimes it helps to read about it.

There are no forums on JFO right now. They MIGHT return one day, but there were a lot of problems with them.  Instead of forums, JFO runs on <strong>BuddyPress</strong>, which allows you to post to the Site Wide Activity Page, have your own special status page for anything you want to talk about (within reason, mind, no porn, for example), send private messages to people, and post in groups.

What are groups, activity, notifications, messaging and all this other stuff? Here's a breakdown!
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/groups/">Group Help</a> - How to join, how to post, how to reply, how to report, how to make a new group and how to leave.</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/notifications/">Notifications</a> - How you know when someone's talking about you</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/messaging/">Private Messaging</a> - Chatting with someone on the QT.</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/profiles/">Profiles</a> - Tell everyone about yourself. Or not. No pressure.</li>
	<li><a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/activity/">Activity</a> - What's going on in the entire site, or just your friends</li>
</ul>

So! If you want to post to the groups, or have your own status page or send private messages, well, then you need an account. Otherwise, I promise you that JFO will remain free for you to just post comments and read everything without having to register.

By the way, I do post bits about how it all works at the <a href="https://jorjafox.net/community/">JFO Community Blog</a>, so if you have have questions that may involve detailed answers, that's where they show up.
