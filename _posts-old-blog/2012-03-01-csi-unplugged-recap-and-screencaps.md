Three stars for Sara.

This episode was also about three stars all around. The plot was convoluted, and I lost track for a moment of who was whom and how everyone was related and why the kid was kidnapped. But that look of joy on Sara's face when SuperDave made light, or when they found the kid, was worth the price of admission.
