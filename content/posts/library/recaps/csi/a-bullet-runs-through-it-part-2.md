## Synopsis

_This episode continues from [A Bullet Runs Through It (Part 1)](/library/recaps/csi/a-bullet-runs-through-it-part-1/)_

In the conclusion of "A Bullet Runs Through It (Part 1)", the detectives and CSI follow the questions of who shot officer Bell, who shot the young boy on his bicycle, and why would a car open fire on a police squad car.

The criminals opened fire on the cop car to distract them from the car the police had originally intended to pull over. Having seen a man strong-arm a pregnant woman into a car, the police had signaled them to pull over, not knowing they were really trafficking drugs. To get the heat off the drug mules, the other car opened fire and led the police away. One of the shooters died while waiting on an ambulance, while two others were killed at the scene. One died in an alley, having thrown his gun onto a roof, only to have it slide back down into his hand and thus appear armed to the police.

One shooter got away, and did indeed kill the young boy for his bicycle to get away.

The final answer is that Jim Brass shot officer Bell. During the fire fight, both men stood up. Bell was hit in the chest, but had on body armor. The shot turned him and Brass, who was shooting across Bell's car (in violation of protocol) accidentally hit Bell.

## Review

Early in the episode, Sofia Curtis comes to unburden herself to Grissom, who repeatedly asks her not to tell him. Sofia is on administrative leave and shouldn't talk to anyone on the force, which is hard since most of her friends are cops, including her mother. As Sofia talks over Grissom's objections, Sara arrives and reinforces Grissom's statement of how Sofia shouldn't be there, talking to them. Sofia spits back that Sara doesn't have many friends outside the force, and Sara offers the name of a police psychologist.

While hunting for the bullet that killed Bell in the alley, Grissom swoops by and asks Sara to work with him, saying it'll be fun. Sara goes along, and seems only mildly annoyed by Grissom's normal quiz and games attitude. Based on the information that there was red clay on the gun of the shooter killed in the alley, and eye-witnesses claimed he'd been unarmed while the cops said otherwise, Grissom reconstruced the situation. Sara demonstrates how the shooter threw the gun up and how he caught it when the gun slid back down.

Finally, Sara and Nick assist Grissom in reconstructing the shooting of Bell, using lasers and dummies. Sara, taking Sofia's position, easily determines the cars would have made it unable for Sofia to have killed Bell. The bullet she found in the candle in the previous episode was the deadly bullet, and only a shot from Brass' position would have caused such a shot.

## Notes

* Sara seems rather curt with Sofia when she finds her talking with Grissom after she's been suspended.
