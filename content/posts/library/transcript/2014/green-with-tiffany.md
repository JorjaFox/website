**Tiffany Paige:** We're here with actress Jorja Fox from CSI. What brings you here tonight?

**Jorja Fox:** I'm very excited about this event, it's an event very close to my heart. I'm representing Artists & Athletes tonight. I'm on the advisory board and we're a collective of artists and athletes that connect with Washington DC on issues that are close to everybody. Kind of create a dialogue between the different camps and bring us together to get things that we care about on the floor and up for conversation.

**TP:** That's so important. Are you an athlete yourself?

**JF:** I'm a surfer. I don't know if that really counts. 

**TP:** Of course that counts. [...] Do you have a green tip? Is there something that you could tell our viewers?

**JF:** Okay, well I'm going out on the edge here, but I'd like to take "Meatless Mondays" into three more days a week. Probably the single-handed biggest thing that any individual can do to really help the environment is to eat vegetarian. And maybe not all the time, but even just more would make a huge difference.

**TP:** That is a good one. So are you a vegetarian?

**JF:** I am, yes.

**TP:** How long have you been a vegetarian?

**JF:** Like ... twenty-two years?

**TP:** Wow! 

**JF:** Yeah like that. You know, for me it's something I don't even think about anymore. It's just... it's not complicated, it's not hard. [...] In terms of raising cattle and raising food, the water that gets used and the land that gets sort of clear-cut to make that happen... you don't think about that when- I mean, why would we?

**TP:** I don't think people put faces to their food. How that works, where their food comes from. That is a great one, thank you for that tip. 

**JF:** Thanks Tiffany.

**TP:** Have a great night.

**JF:** Alright, you too.
