Depending on who you ask (and I suppose what shoe's she's wearing), Jorja's between 5'9" and 5'11"

Elisabeth Shue, however, is an itsy 5'2", as came up when we were all looking at pictures of Jorja and Elisabeth. I called her a pocket CSI.

Stephhanie Simons says Jorja makes her feel tall, though:

By the way, Stephanie mentions Jorja in her book (and Jorja has a copy), so check uot her blog at <a href="http://stephsimons.com">http://stephsimons.com</a> and pick up her book yourself! Word of warning, it's a grown-up book, for the folks who like "Robot Chicken" and "The Family Guy." Under 18-ers, check with your folks first, or wait till your birthday. (And I'm pretty sure Jorja knows we're not the crazy stalker chicks, Stephanie!)
