Actress **Jorja Fox** is a committed environmentalist and animal rights activist. As I've just seen in an amusing video, she's also really into biking. The clip shows Jorja and SpinDaily host, Katherine, Orange20 Bikes in LA and checking out all the new models -- from hybrid to fixed gear. It's a pretty candid take on their time there with Jorja and Katherine performing "ride-bys" while singing songs. As Cyclelicious points out, there are also some great quotes:

"If I had a bike, I wouldn't have to worry about two hour parking or parking meters. It would save me hundreds of dollars a year on parking tickets."

"Prius. That's a cop out."

Anyways, have a glance at the video. With Spring arriving, I can't wait to start biking again. Looks like Jorja Fox will be enjoying the same thing.
