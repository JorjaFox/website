I always get so excited for the Green with Glamour seasonal celeb photoshoots - they're festive, fashion-y and oh-so-sexy! For the Spring/Summer 09 look, we were feeling pretty damned good about ourselves and went for a 'top of the world' theme, deliciously shot on the rooftop of The Chapman Building (many thanks to GwG's dear friend and loft tenant, Matthew Vafiadis!) The location was divine, but I have to admit the whole inspiration for our 'world-topping' thing came once I knew the lovely Jorja Fox was on board to be our 'model'. From afar she just seems to ooze a relaxed confidence, right? Well, let me tell you... up close she does not disappoint! Arriving poised, professional and completely good-spirited, Jorja set the tone for a luscious photoshoot & overall brilliant day!

So... we let the champagne flow, munched on vegan yummies (curried mango & tempeh sandwich recipe here), soaked in the gorgeous day and went to work! [...]

Artfully shot by photographer, Lelah Foster, the finished photos are a dream come true! Utilizing the open space, the soft sun and the colors & shapes of downtown LA, Lelah perfectly framed Jorja's smouldering beauty and determined gaze. I know... I'm gushing, but it really was a perfect day. Model = amazing, Photographer (& assist., Chad) = brillsville, Clothing = perfection (of course!), Make up & Hair = a divine cross-section of editorial meets wearable (Big thank yous to Alyson Granaderos and Tamami Ito respectively!!!), and behind-the-scenes photos and general production helping hand = my husband & #1 supporter... total harmony!

And to push the feel-good even further, once the GwG photos were captured, Jorja swapped her designer clothes (check what she wore here) for a PETA tee and posed for the campaign to STOP the clubbing of Canadian seals - some serious multi-tasking! At the end of the day, we are beyond thrilled with the results and so proud to have Jorja - and the rest of the team - play such important roles in the world of Green with Glamour!
