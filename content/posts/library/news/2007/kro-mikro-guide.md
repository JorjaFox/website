Every young actress with ambition hopes to make it in movies. But if it doesn't work out the way you wanted, television can be a great alternative for a successful career. A great example of this is Jorja Fox (38).

She has appeared on the hit series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] for six years. Previous, she appeared on two other hit series: [[ER]] and [[The West Wing]].

Anyone who tries to remember her movies, probably comes up with [[Memento]]. In that movie, she played the wife of the main character, played by Guy Pearce, who, short after the death of his wife, loses his memory. Practically speaking, there were just a few short scenes with Jorja in it, so there was not so much acting involved. So Jorja concentrated on television.

Jorja Fox, born on 7 July 1968 in New York, daughter of Canadian immigrants, spent her childhood in Florida. When she was 15, she won a modeling contest, which really amazed her because she was the only brunette in the contest. After winning the contest she moved to New York. After three years of modeling in America and Europe she stopped, she wanted to be an actress.

She attended the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York and started a long road of small roles in TV series and films for seven years. In 1996 she got her first big role as the no-nonsense Dr. [[Maggie Doyle]] in the hit series ER. The role of the vegetarian lesbian doctor fit Jorja perfectly, because she is both herself. She appeared in 33 episodes of ER and after that she tried movies again. She appeared in three movies, the last of which being Memento. In 2000 she played an agent of the Secret Service, protecting the daughter of the president, in the West wing.

Right now Jorja plays [[Sara Sidle]] in CSI, which recently celebrated their 150st episode. There was a little problem in 2004 when she refused to sign her contract for the new season. But soon she realized that she didn't want to quit playing this great role on this hit series.
