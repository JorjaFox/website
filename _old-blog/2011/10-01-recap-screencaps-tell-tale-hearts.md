**Screencaps:
**Oh let's just do it right.  There are 65 screencaps.  Go on.  <a href="https://jorjafox.net/gallery/tv/csi/season12/telltalehearts">See all the screencaps</a>.

**Recap:**
As an episode this was a good one.  As a _Sara_ episode, it max's out at two stars.  We really only had four scenes with Sara, and while seeing her tease Morgan was cute, it wasn't a lot of Sara.  Thankfully next week looks to be Sara Heavy.
