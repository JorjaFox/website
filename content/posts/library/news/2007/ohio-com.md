Can you please enlighten me about Jorja Fox/Sara leaving on "CSI"? Surely CBS is not abandoning the romance story between her and Grissom after teasing us about it for over a year?! Will Sarah come back to the "CSI" show or have we seen the last of her? It would be a real bummer if she disappears from the show. I may quit watching if she goes!

1p6,1p6 Before Fox's departure, it was widely reported that she and "CSI" could not agree on a new contract. But Fox told Entertainment Weekly that she had grown weary of the show and that, "There are so many things I want to do! Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old." Still, she said that if a chance to guest-star came up, she would be thrilled. And a "CSI" producer told TV Guide that Fox will be back at some point.
