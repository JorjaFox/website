Spoilers. If you didn't think that already.

> "What I can share is that it is going to be a crowd pleaser, and the true diehard fans will be satisfied," Helgenberger told FOX411 at the CBS Television Critics Association party on Tuesday. "There's a lot of story that will get wrapped up and a lot of fan favorite characters are brought back. I was satisfied.  I think fans will be, too.”
>
> One of the returning characters will be Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke), who transformed throughout the series from a dominatrix to a therapist specializing in sexual counseling.
>
> "For the true fans that watch that show, they know that character had a real impact on Grissom and then the whole Sara [Jorja Fox] thing happened," Helgenberger said. "Lady Heather weighs heavily in the story in terms of the crime that is committed and in terms of the Sara/Grissom relationship."

On the crime front, Marg explains that there's a 'federal incident' at Sam Braun's old casino, which Catherine owns if you'll recall. Catherine is still with the FBI, but being the only one of Braun's family <em>not</em> in jail, she inherited the kit and kaboodle.
