## Synopsis

The CSIs work two cases, one of a high school student, Vincent Bartley, whose head is found along side the road, and the other of a rich pornographer, Huxley, found dead in a blind eatery. Vinnie was a Go-Kart enthusiast who'd lost his head in a race on the streets, getting it and his hand severed by a blown out truck tire. Huxley was killed out of a waiter's revenge on the restaurant's chef, who had made her living off his ideas and their past relationship.

Meanwhile, Grissom and Sara are under review for their relationship, which is in violation of lab policy. Grissom dodges the review for most of the day. The other CSIs discuss Grissom and Sara's relationship during their cases.

## Review

Sara returns to the lab to have her review with Conrad Ecklie. Having a relationship with another member of the team is in violation of policy. Ecklie asks when Grissom and Sara first began their relationship, to which Sara points out they've always had a relationship. She claims they became intimate two years ago, on a Sunday.

Grissom, however, states they first ...you know_'d nine years ago, prompting Ecklie to tell Grissom they needed to get their stories straight. The two met nine years ago at a Forensics Academy Conference, where Sara wore her hair in a ponytail and asked too many questions about anthropology, while trying to get up the nerve to ask Grissom out to dinner.

In the end, Sara moves to the Swing shift, so she's no longer under Grissom's supervision. While Grissom had planned to do so, Sara didn't want the rest of the team to suffer. They go, together, to the Go Kart track, and Grissom races with the other CSIs. The episode ends as Sara stands alone, separated from the Night shift team.
