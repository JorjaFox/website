It's a borderline four, and I'm willing to change the rate if you guys think I was too harsh, but there was a big gap in the middle, and not a lot of Science Sara (my favorite Sara).

</ul>
This was shades of Hannah. Young, smart, kid and his brothers pulling off a 'perfect' crime. But not too perfect with science being what it is. There was a lot of subtle Sara's Past references through the whole thing. Her time as a foster kid, the child of a murdered father, and so on. And, of course, Hannah. Sara, again, connected with the kid, but this time she didn't let it override her good sense of the facts.

My how she's grown!
