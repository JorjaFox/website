<img src="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2008/12/cookie.png" alt="" title="Birthday Cake" style="float:left;width:128px;" /> As JFO inches towards it's 12th birthday (and let us all pause humbly at that thought), I've been slogging away at cleaning up the site.  The small (and admittedly not so small) layout and image tweaks are to better support you, but also to keep the site growing.  My goal is, as it's always been, to provide a place where you can learn about Jorja Fox and discuss her career and advocacy in a healthy, polite and respectful environment.  I would never have been able to do this without people like you.  The fans.

As websites grow and change, and as Jorja's career moves from CSI to whatever's next, I feel it important to balance two things:

1. To report on news about Jorja Fox
2. The desire to be web 'forward' (i.e. make the site look good and work for the majority of people)

To meet those goals, I'm refusing to turn the site into the pretty, image and media heavy flash site I've had mocked up on my hard drive for a year. Instead, I've been upgrading the header images, tweaking the sidebar to cram in more information without being crowded, still allow for the 'center' content to be read without too much side-scrolling, and have it fit on multiple browsers and multiple OSs.

We're not done yet, I'm sure. A good website never ends its updates. Thanks for being here while our road goes ever on.
