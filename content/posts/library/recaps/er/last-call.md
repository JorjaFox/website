## Summary

Dr. Ross brings a one-night-stand into the hospital when she has an epileptic seizure, earning him the stares of his colleagues when he can't remember her name. Carter screws up Benton's lecture when he realizes his presentation materials were in his apartment fire. Keaton takes a shine to Carter, meanwhile, when he persuades a teenage girl to undergo surgery. Carter also finds a place to live, with Dennis Gant. Jeanie begins experiencing side effects from her medication and is asked out by a handsome construction worker. Carol ponders enrolling in med school.
