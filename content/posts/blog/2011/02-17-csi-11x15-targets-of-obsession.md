Personally I think he need a haircut, but seeing as the girls of my generation were obsessed with NKOTB, I don't really have a lot of room here (not me! I was into Metallica, Aerosmith, Guns'n'Roses and Indigo Girls at that age... which probably says a lot, eh?).

<h3>Official Release</h3>
Langston testifies against the notorious "Dick & Jane" killer, Nate Haskell. Meanwhile, Nick receives a call from troubled teen Jason McCann (special guest star Justin Bieber) to warn him of impending danger.

<h3>Recap</h3>

Yes, Jorja WAS in the episode, but she was a lab rat.  Two stars for Sara, and ... 3/4 for the episode, depending on your point of view.  Bieber is not a good actor, though he's much better than last time. His death scene was amusing.  Nate Haskell's trial ended predictably.  And then he escaped.  He's now been on more than any other special guest. And he still bores me.
