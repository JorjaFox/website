<a href="//static.jorjafox.net/wordpress/2010/04/forums.png"><img src="https://jorjafox.net/community/files/2010/04/forums-100x100.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18" /></a> The forums are taking a nap. There were no new posts for months except a couple questions.  What I want to do is make some more groups, which by the way, any of you can join, and let you guys chat all you want that way.  Anyone can post into an group <em>except</em> the 'JFO' announcement one. Makes sense, don't it?

Now that said, someone's probably noticed that only site members can join up to groups and post comments.  This is true!  The reason for it is that we've had a couple people harassing folks.  I don't want to open it up just yet.

If you just want to comment on the blog posts, carry on as you have been, I won't be changing that any time soon.  If you want to join groups or send messages and make friends in that sort of community way, then yeah, you need an account.
